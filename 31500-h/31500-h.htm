<h3>INTRODUCTORY</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> twentieth century is the age of Woman;
some day, it may be that it will be looked back
upon as the golden age, the dawn, some say, of
feminine civilisation. We cannot estimate as yet;
and no man can tell what forces these new conditions
may not release in the soul of woman.
The modern change is that the will of woman is
asserting itself. Women are looking for a satisfactory
life, which is to be determined from within
themselves, not from without by others. The
result is a discontent that may well prove to be
the seed or spring of further changes in a society
which has yet to find its normal organisation. Yes,
women are finding themselves, and men are discovering
what women mean.</p>

<p>In the present time we are passing through a
difficult period of transition. There are conditions
of change that have to be met, the outcome of
which it is very difficult to appreciate. A transformation
in the thought and conduct of women,
for which the term &#8220;revolution&#8221; is not too strong,
is taking place around us; doubtless many experimental
phases will be tried before we reach a new
position of equilibrium.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>This must be. There can be no life without
movement.</p>

<p>The expression, &#8220;a transition period,&#8221; is, of
course, only relative. We often say: This or that
is a sign of the present era; and, nine times out of
ten, the thing we believe to be new is in reality as
old as the world itself. In one sense the whole of
history is a vast transition. No period stands
alone; the present is in every age merely the
shifting point at which the past and the future
meet. All things move onwards. But the movement
sometimes takes the form of a cataract, at
others of an even and almost imperceptible current.
This is really another way of saying that the usually
slow and gradual course of change is, at certain
stages, interrupted by a more or less prolonged
period of revolution. The process of growth, from
being gradual and imperceptible, becomes violent
and conscious.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that what is called
the &#8220;Woman&#8217;s Movement,&#8221; with its disintegrating
influences on social opinion and practice, is bringing
vast and momentous changes in women&#8217;s attitude
towards the universe and towards themselves. A
great motive and an enlarging ideal, a quickening
of the woman&#8217;s spirit, a stirring dream of a new
order&mdash;these are what we have gained. We are
carried on, though as yet we know not whither,
and there is, of necessity, a little stumbling of our
feet as we seek for a way. Hence the fear, always
tending to arise in periods of social reconstruction,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
which is felt by many to-day as women pass out
far beyond the established boundaries prescribed
for their sex.</p>

<p>Whoever reflects soberly on the past history of
women will not be surprised at their present movement
towards emancipation. Women are reclaiming
a position that is theirs by natural right&mdash;a
position which once they held. It may be all very
well for those who accept the authority and headship
of the man as the foundation of the family
and of society, to be filled with bewildered fear at
what seems to them to be a quite new assertion
of rights on the part of the mothers of the race.
But has the family at all stages of growth been
founded on the authority of the father? Our decision
on this question will affect our outlook on
the whole question of Woman&#8217;s Rights and the
relationships of the two sexes. There are civilisations,
older and, as I believe, wiser than ours that
have accepted the predominant position of the
mother as the great central fact on which the family
has been established.</p>

<p>The view that the family, much as it existed
among the Hebrew patriarchs, and as it exists
to-day, was primeval and universal is very deeply
rooted. This is not surprising. To reverse the
gaze of men from themselves is no easy task. The
predominance of the male over the female, of
the man over the woman and of the father over the
mother, has been accepted, almost without question,
in a civilisation built up on the recognition of male<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
values and male standards of opinion. Thus the
institutions, habits, prejudices, and superstitions
of the patriarchal authority rest like an incubus
upon us. The women of to-day carry the dead
load upon their backs, and literally stagger beneath
the accumulating burden of the ages.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Woman&#8217;s Movement&#8221; is pressing us forward
towards a recasting of the patriarchal view of
the relative position and duties of the two sexes.
It must be regarded as an extremely great and
comprehensive movement affecting the whole of
life. From this wider standpoint, the fight for the
parliamentary suffrage is but as the vestibule to
progress; the possession of the vote being no more
than a necessary condition for attaining far larger
and more fundamental ends.</p>

<p>It is, however, very necessary to remark that the
recognition of this imposes a great responsibility
upon women. For one thing the practical difficulties
of the present must be faced. It is far from easy
to readjust existing conditions to meet the new
demands. Present social and economic conditions
are to a great extent chaotic. We cannot safely
cast aside, in any haste for reform, those laws,
customs and opinions which it has been the slow
task of our civilisation to establish, not for men
only, but for women. We women have to work
out many questions far more thoroughly than
hitherto we have done. We owe this to our
movement and to the world of men. It will serve
nothing to pull down, unless we are ready also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
to build up. Freedom can be granted only to the
self-disciplined.</p>

<hr />

<p>This little book is an attempt to establish the
position of the mother in the family. It sets out
to investigate those early states of society, when,
through the widespread prevalence of descent
through the mother, the survival of the family
clan and, in some cases, the property rights were
dependent on women and not on men. I start
from the belief that the mother was at one period
the dominant partner in the sexual relationships.
This does not, however, at all necessarily involve
&#8220;rule by women.&#8221; We must be very clear here.
What I claim is this. The system by which the
family was built up and grouped around the mother
conferred special rights on women. The form of
marriage favourable to this influence was that by
which the husband entered the wife&#8217;s family and
clan, and lived there as a &#8220;consort-guest.&#8221; The
wife and mother was director in the home, the
owner of the meagre property, the distributor of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>food, and the controller of the children.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Hence
arises what is known as mother-right.</p>

<p>I am prompted to this inquiry by two reasons:
in the first place, the origin of the maternal-system
and the subsequent association of the mother and
the father appear to me to afford evidence of the
working of a natural law of the two sexes, which,
both for social and other reasons, is of great interest
in the present stage of women&#8217;s history. The
establishing of the mother&#8217;s position is of great
importance. If we can prove that women have
exercised unquestioned and direct authority in the
past history of human societies, we shall be in a
position to answer those who to-day wish to set
limits to women&#8217;s activities. Then, in the second
place, I am compelled to doubt certain conclusions,
both of those who accept mother-right, and also of
the greater number who now deny its occurrence.
If I am right, and the importance of the maternal
family has been unduly neglected and the true
explanation of its origin overlooked, I feel that,
whatever errors I may fall into, I am justified in
undertaking this task. My mistakes will be corrected
by others with more knowledge than I can
claim; and if my theory of mother-right has any
merit, it will be established in more competent
hands. The vast majority of investigators on these
questions are men. I am driven to believe that
sometimes they are mistaken in their interpretation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>of habits and customs which arose among primitive
societies in which the influence of women was
marked. In dealing with the family and its origin
it has been usual to consider the male side and to
pass over the female members. This has led, I
am sure, to much error.</p>

<p>The custom of tracing descent through the mother,
either practised consciously and completely, or only
as a survival, occurs among many primitive peoples
in all parts of the world. Whether, however, it
existed universally and from all time, or whether
only in certain races, among whose institutions it
remains or may still be traced, is a much debated
question. Not all barbarous tribes are in the stage
of mother-right; on the contrary many reckon
descent through the father. But even where the
latter is the case, vestiges of the former system are
frequently to be found. There seems to be a
common tendency to discredit a system of relationship,
which suggests even as a bare possibility the
mother, and not the father, being the head of the
family. Yet, I believe I can assign some, at least
plausible, reasons for believing that descent through
women has been a stage, though not, I think, the
first stage, in social growth for all branches of the
human family.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt of the importance of
kinship and inheritance being reckoned through the
mother. If the children belong to her, and if by
marriage the husband enters her home, the greater
influence, based on the present possession of property,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and the future hope of the family rests on
the female side. Such conditions must have exercised
strong influence on the position of the women
members of the primitive clan and the honour in
which they were held. It cannot be ignored.</p>

<p>Of course, this does not prevent the hardships of
savage life weighing more heavily in many ways
upon women than on the stronger men. In primitive
societies women have a position quite as full of
anomalies as they hold among civilised races.
Among some tribes their position is extremely
good; among others it is undoubtedly bad, but,
speaking generally, it is much better than usually
it is held to be.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Obviously the causes must be
sought in the environment and in social organisation.
The differences in the status and power of
women, often occurring in tribes at the same level
of progress, would seem to be dependent largely
on economic conditions. The subject is full of
difficulties. Not only is the position of women
thus variable, but our knowledge of the matter is
very defective. It is seldom, indeed, that the
question has been considered of sufficient importance
to receive accurate attention.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Not infrequently
conflicting accounts are given by different
authorities, and even by the same writer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p><p>I wish it to be understood that mother-right does
not necessarily imply mother-rule. This system
may even be combined with the patriarchal authority
of the male. The unfortunate use of the term <i>Matriarchate</i>
has led to much confusion. My own knowledge
and study of primitive customs and ancient
civilisations have made it plain to me that there
has been a constant rise and fall of male and female
dominance, but, I believe, that, on the whole, the
superiority of women has been more frequent and
more successful than that of men.</p>

<p>It is this that I shall attempt to prove.</p>

<p>The theory of mother-right has been subjected
to so much criticism that a re-examination of the
position is very necessary. To show its prevalence,
to establish some leading points in its history, to
make out its connection with the patriarchal family,
and to trace the transition by which one system
passed into the other, appear to me to be matters
primarily important. The limited compass of this
little book will prevent my substantiating my own
views as I should wish, with a full and systematic
survey of all authentic accounts of the peoples
among whom mother-descent may be studied. I
have considered, however, that I could summarise
the position in a comprehensive picture, that will,
I hope, suggest a point of view that seems to me to
have been very generally neglected.</p>

<p>It is necessary to enter into such an inquiry with
caution; the difficulties before me are very great.
Nothing would be easier than from the mass of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
material available to pile up facts in furnishing a
picture of the high status of women among many
tribes under the favourable influence of mother-descent,
that would unnerve any upholders of the
patriarchal view of the subordination of women.
It is just possible, on the other hand, to interpret
these facts from a fixed point of thought of the
father&#8217;s authority as the one support of the family,
and then to argue that, in spite of the mother&#8217;s
control over her children and over property, she
still remained the inferior partner. I wish to do
neither. It is my purpose to examine the evidence,
and so to discover to what extent the system of
tracing descent through the female side conferred
any special claim for consideration upon women.
I shall try to avoid mistakes. I put forward my
own opinions with great diffidence. It is so easy,
as I realise full well, to interpret facts by the bias
of one&#8217;s own wishes. I know that the habits and
customs of primitive peoples that I have studied
closely are probably few in comparison with those
I have missed; yet to me they appear of such
importance in the light they throw on the whole
question of the relationships of the two sexes, that
it seems well to bring them forward.</p>

<p>Since my attention, now many years ago, was
first directed to this question, I have felt that a
clear and concise account of the mother-age was
indispensable for women. Such an account, with a
criticism of the patriarchal theory, is here offered.
Throughout I have attempted to clear up and bring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
into uniformity the two opposing theories of the
origin of the human family. I have tried to gather
the facts, very numerous and falling into several
classes, by which the theory of the mother-age could
be supported. And first it was necessary to clear
out of the way a body of opinion, the prevalence of
which has opposed an obstacle to the acceptance of
the rights of mothers in the family relationship.
The whole question turns upon which you start
with; the man&mdash;the woman, or the woman&mdash;the man.</p>

<p>Here it should be explained that this little book
is an expansion of the historical section which
treats of &#8220;the Mother-age civilisation&#8221; in my
former book, <i>The Truth About Woman</i>. I wish
to take this opportunity of expressing my gratitude
for the generous interest and sympathy with which
my work has been received. Such kindness is very
imperfectly repaid by an author&#8217;s thanks; it is
certainly the best incentive to further work.</p>

<p>This little volume was suggested to me by a review
in one of the Suffrage papers. The writer, after
speaking of the interest to women of the mother-age
and the difficulty there was in gaining information
on the subject, said that &#8220;a small and cheaper
book on the matriarchate would be useful to women
in all countries.&#8221; I was grateful for this suggestion.
I at once felt that I wanted to write such a
book. For one thing, this particular section on
the mother-age in <i>The Truth About Woman</i>, and
my belief in the favourable influence of mother-descent
on the status of women, has been much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
questioned. I have been told that I &#8220;had quite
deliberately gone back to our uncivilised ancestors
to &#8216;fish up&#8217; the precedent of the matriarchate;&#8221;
that I &#8220;had allowed my prejudices to dictate my
choice of material, and had thus brought forward
examples explanatory of my own opinions;&#8221; that
I &#8220;had fastened eagerly on these, without inquiring
too carefully about other facts having a contrary
tendency.&#8221; I was reminded of what I well knew,
that the matriarchate and promiscuity with which
it is usually connected were not universally accepted
by anthropologists; the tendency to-day being to
discredit both as being among the early phases of
society. It was suggested that I &#8220;had unprofitably
spent my time on the historical section of my
book, and had built up my theory on a curiously
uncertain foundation;&#8221; that I &#8220;had relied too
much on the certain working of mother-right, and
had been by no means clear in showing how, from
such a position of power, women had sunk into
subservience to patriarchal rule.&#8221; In fact, it has
seemed to be the opinion of my critics that I had
allowed what I &#8220;would have liked to have happened
to affect my account of what did happen in
the infancy of man&#8217;s social life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, I want to say quite frankly, that I feel much
of this criticism is just. The inquiry on the mother-age
civilisation was only one small section of my
book on Woman. I realise that very much was
hurried over. There is on this subject of the origin
of the family a literature so extensive, and such a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
variety of opinions, that the work of the student
is far from easy. The whole question is too extensive
to allow anything like adequate treatment
within the space of a brief, and necessarily insufficient,
summary. My earlier investigation may
well be objected to as not being in certain points
supported by sufficient proofs. I know this. It is
not easy to condense the marriage customs and
social habits of many different peoples into a few
dozen pages. Of course, I selected my examples.
But this I may say; I chose those which had
brought me to accept mother-right. I was driven
to this belief by my own study and reading long
before the time of writing my book. What I really
tried to do was to present to others the facts that
had convinced me. But my stacks of unused notes,
collected for my own pleasure during many years
of work, are witness to how much I had to leave out.</p>

<p>I know that many objections that have been raised
to the theory of mother-right were left unanswered.
I dismissed much too lightly the patriarchal theory
of the origin of the family, which during late years
has gained such advocacy. I failed to carry my
inquiry far enough back. I accepted with too little
caution an early period of promiscuous sexual relationships.
I did not make clear the stages in the
advance of the family to the clan and the tribe; nor
examine with sufficient care the later transition period
in which mother-right gave place to father-right.</p>

<p>I have been sent back to examine again my own
position. And to do this, it was necessary first to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
take up the question from the position of those whose
views are in opposition to my own. I have made
a much more extensive study of those authorities
who, rejecting mother-right, accept a modification
of the patriarchal theory as the origin of the family.
This has led to some considerable recasting of my
views. Not at all, however, to a change in my belief
in mother-right, which, indeed, has now been
strengthened, and, as I trust, built up on surer
foundations.</p>

<p>By a fortunate chance, I was advised to read
Mr. Andrew Lang&#8217;s <i>Social Origins</i>,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> which work
includes Mr. Atkinson&#8217;s <i>Primal Law</i>. I am greatly
indebted to the assistance I have gained from these
writers. It is, perhaps, curious that a very careful
study of the patriarchal family as it is presented by
Mr. Atkinson and Mr. Lang, has brought me to a
conclusion fundamentally at variance from what
might have been expected. I have gained invaluable
support for my own belief in mother-right, and have
found fresh proofs from the method of difference. I
have cleared up many points that previously puzzled
me. I am able now to accept the patriarchal theory,
without at all shaking my faith in a subsequent
period of mother-descent and mother-power.</p>

<p>The discussion on this question is now half a
century old. Yet in spite of the opposition of many
investigators, and the support of others, the main
problems are still unsettled. What form did the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>family take in its earliest stage? Did it start as a
small group or with the clan or horde? What were
the earliest conditions of the sexual relationships?
Was promiscuity at one period the rule? Was the
foundation of the family based on the authority of the
father, or of the mother? If on that of the father,
how is mother-kin and mother-right to be explained?
These are among the questions that must be answered.
Not till this is done, can we establish any
theory of mother-descent, or estimate its effect on
the status of women.</p>

<p>The whole subject is a very wide and complicated
one. If I differ on several important points from
learned authorities, whose knowledge and research
far exceed my own, I do so only after great hesitation,
and because I must. The facts they have
collected from their personal knowledge of primitive
peoples (facts which I have gratefully used) often
suggest quite opposite conclusions to my thoughts
than to theirs&mdash;the view-point is different, that is
all. They were seeking for one thing; I for another:
they were men; I am a woman. It would be foolishness
for me to attempt any special pleadings for my
own opinions. How far I shall succeed, or fail, to
make clear to others a period of mother-right that
is certain to me, I do not know. I offer my little
book with all humility, and yet without any apology.
We may read and learn and gather knowledge from
many sources; but the opinions of others we cannot
take on credit; we must re-think them out for
ourselves, and make them our own.</p>

<h3>AN EXPOSITION OF BACHOFEN&#8217;S THEORY OF
THE MATRIARCHATE</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Fifty-three</span> years ago in his great work, <i>Das
Mutterrecht</i>,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> the Swiss writer, Bachofen, drew the
attention of the world to the fact that a system
of kinship through mothers only prevailed among
many primitive peoples, while survivals of the
custom could be widely, if but faintly, traced
among civilised races. Drawing his evidence from
the actual statements of old writers, but more
from legends and the mythologies of antiquity, he
came to the conclusion that a system of descent
through women had, in all cases, preceded the rise
of kinship through males. Almost at the same
time Dr. J.&nbsp;F. McLennan,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> ignorant of the work
of Bachofen, came to the same opinion. This led
to a reconsideration of the patriarchal theory; and
for a time it was widely held that in the early
stages of society a matriarchate prevailed, in which
women held the supreme power. Further support
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>came from Morgan, with his knowledge of the
maternal family among American aborigines, and
he was followed by Professor Tylor, McGee, and
many other investigators.</p>

<p>Obviously this gyn&aelig;cocratic view, which placed
woman in a new relation to man, was unlikely to be
permanently accepted. Thus a reaction to the earlier
theory of the patriarchal family has set in, especially
in recent years. Many writers, while acknowledging
the existence of mother descent, deny that such a
system carries with it, except in a few exceptional
cases, mother-rights of special advantage to women;
even when these seem to be present they believe
such rights to be more apparent than real.</p>

<p>In bringing forward any theory of mother-right,
it thus becomes necessary to show the causes that
have led to this reversal in opinion. To do this,
the first step will be to examine, with considerable
detail, the evidence for the matriarchal theory as
it is given by its two great supporters. Now, an
interesting point arises, if we compare the view
of Bachofen with that held by McLennan. No
two ways could well be further apart than those
by which these two men arrived at the same conclusion.
Both accept an early period of promiscuous
sexual relationships. But Bachofen found the explanation
of mother-descent in the supremacy of
women, and believed a matriarchate to have been
established by them in a moral revolt against such
<i>heta&iuml;rism</i>. Mr. McLennan, on the other hand,
regarded the custom as due to uncertainty of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
paternity&mdash;the children were called after the mother
because the father was unknown.</p>

<p>Let us concentrate our attention on the <i>Das
Mutterrecht</i> of Bachofen, whose work as the great
champion of matriarchy claims our most careful
consideration. And it is necessary to say at once
that there can be no doubt his view of women&#8217;s
supremacy is greatly exaggerated. Such a rule of
women, at the very early stage of society when
mother-kin is supposed to have arisen, is not
proved, and does not seem probable. Even if it
existed, <i>it could not have originated in the way and
for the reasons</i> that are credited by the Swiss writer.
I wish to emphasise this point. Much of the discredit
that has fallen on the matriarchate has
arisen, I am certain, through the impossibility of
accepting Bachofen&#8217;s mythical account of its origin.
This great supporter of women was a dreamer,
rather than a calm and impartial investigator.
Founding his main theory on assumptions, he asks
us to accept these as historical facts. Much of his
work and his belief in women must be regarded as
the rhapsodies of a poet. And yet, it is the poet who
finds the truth. The poetic spirit is, in one sense, the
most practical of all. Bachofen saw the fact of
mother-power, though not <i>why</i> it was the fact, and he
enfolded his arguments in a garment of pure fiction.</p>

<p>To disengage from his learned book, <i>Das Mutterrecht</i>,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
his theory of the origin of the Matriarchate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>is no easy task. There is, for one thing, such
bewildering contradiction and confusion in the
material used. Then the interpretation of the
mythical tales, so freely intermingled everywhere,
is often strained&mdash;prompted by a poetic imagination
which snatches at every kind of allegory. Often
the views expressed are inconsistent with each other,
the arguments and proofs are disconnected, while
many of the details are hopelessly obscure and
confused. Yet it seems to me possible to recognise
the idea which brings into unity the mass of his
work&mdash;the spirit, as it were, that breathes into it
its life. It may be found in the clear appreciation
of the superstitious and mystical element in primitive
man, and their close interweaving with the sexual
life. As I understand Herr Bachofen, the sex-act
was the means which first opened up ways to great
heights, but also to great depths.</p>

<p>Bachofen strongly insists on the religious element
in all early human thought. He believes that the
development of the primitive community only
advanced by means of religious ideas.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Religion,&#8221; he says, &#8220;is the only efficient lever
of all civilisation. Each elevation and depression
of human life has its origin in a movement which
begins in this supreme department.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p></div>

<p>The authority for this belief is sought in religious
myths.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Mythical tradition appears to be the faithful interpretation
of the progress of the law of life, at a time
when the foundations of the historical development
of the ancient world were laid; it reveals the original
mode of thought, and we may accept this direct
revelation as true from our complete confidence
in this source of history.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p></div>

<p>This mystical religious element, which is the
essential part of <i>Das Mutterrecht</i>, is closely connected
by Bachofen with the power of women.
As it is his belief that, even at this early period,
the religious impulse was more developed among
women than men, he bases on this unproved hypothesis
his theory of women&#8217;s supremacy. &#8220;Wherever
gyn&aelig;cocracy meets us,&#8221; he says, &#8220;the mystery
of religion is bound up with it, and lends to motherhood
an incorporation in some divinity.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Doubtless this theory of a higher feminine
spirituality is a pleasing one for women&mdash;but is it
true? The insuperable difficulty to its acceptance
arises, in the first place, from the fact that we can
know nothing at all of the spiritual condition of
the human beings among whom mother-kin was
held first to have been practised. But we must go
further than this in our doubt. Can we accept for
any period a spiritual superiority in the character
of woman over man? To me, at least, it is clear
that a knowledge of the two sexes among all races
both primitive and civilised&mdash;yes, and among ourselves,
is sufficient to discredit such a supposition.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p><p>Bachofen would have us believe that<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> the mother-right
of the ancient world, was due to a revolt of
women against the degraded condition of promiscuity,
which previously had been universal among
mankind, a condition in which men had a community
of wives, and <i>openly lived together like gregarious
animals</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Women, by their nature nobler and more
spiritual than men, became disgusted with this
lawless <i>heta&iuml;rism</i>, and, under the influence of a
powerful religious impulse, combined in a revolt
(the first Amazonian movement) to put an end to
promiscuity and established marriage.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Over and over again Bachofen affirms this spiritual
quality in women.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The woman&#8217;s religious attitude, in particular,
the tendency of her mind towards the supernatural
and the divine, influenced the man and robbed him
of the position which nature disposed him to take
in virtue of his physical superiority. In this way
women&#8217;s position was transformed by religious
considerations, until they became in civil life what
religion had caused them to be.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> And again:
&#8220;We cannot fail to see that of the two forms of
gyn&aelig;cocracy in question&mdash;religious and civil&mdash;the
former was the basis of the latter. Ideas connected
with worship came first, and the civil forms of
life were then the result and expression.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p></div>

<p>We may note in passing, the greater affectability
of woman&#8217;s nature, which would seem always to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>have had a tendency to expression in religio-erotic
manifestations. But to build up a theory of
matriarchy on this foundation is strangely wide of
the facts. Bachofen adduces the spirituality of
women as the cause of their power. But on what
grounds can such a claim be supported?</p>

<p>It is on the evidence of licentious customs of all
kinds and on polyandry, that he bases his belief
in a period of promiscuity. He regards this early
condition of <i>heta&iuml;rism</i> as a law of nature, and believes
that after its infraction by the introduction
of individual marriage, expiation was required to
be made to the Earth Goddess, Demeter, in temporary
prostitution. Hence he explains the widespread
custom of religious prostitution. This
fanciful idea may be taken to represent Bachofen&#8217;s
method of interpretation. There is an intermediate
stage between <i>heta&iuml;rism</i> and marriage, such as the
group-marriage, held by him to have been practised
among barbarous peoples. &#8220;Each man has a
wife, but they are all permitted to have intercourse
with the wives of others.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Great stress is laid on the acquisition by women
of the benefits of a marriage law. In the families
founded upon individual marriage, which grew up
after the Amazonian revolt, the women, and not
the men, held the first place. Bachofen does not
tell us whether they assigned this place to themselves,
or had it conceded to them. Women were the heads
of the families, the children were named after the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>mother, and not the father, and all the relations
to which rights of succession attached were traced
through women only. All property was held by
women. Moreover, from this headship, women
assigned to themselves, or had conceded to them,
the social and political power as well as the domestic
supremacy.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The authority for this remarkable theory is
sought, with great ingenuity and patience, in the
fragmentary accounts of barbarous people, and in
an exhaustive study of heroic stories and religious
myths. Bachofen argues powerfully for the acceptance
of these myths.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Every age unconsciously obeys, even in its
poetry, the laws of its individual life. A patriarchal
age could not, therefore, have invented the matriarchate,
and the myths which describe the latter
may be regarded as trustworthy witnesses of its
historical existence. It may be taken for granted
that the myths did not refer to special persons
and occurrences, but only tell us of the social
customs and ideas which prevailed, or were endeavouring
to prevail, in several communities.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p></div>

<p>This is true. It is the interpretation given to
many of these myths that one is compelled to
question. Bachofen&#8217;s way of applying mythical
tales has no scientific method; for one thing,
abstract ideas are added to primitive legends which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>could only arise from the thought of civilised
peoples. For instance, he accepts, without any
doubt, the existence of the Amazons; and believes
that the myths which refer to them record &#8220;a
revolt for the elevation of the feminine sex, and
through them of mankind.&#8221; It is on such insecure
foundations he builds up his matriarchal theory.</p>

<p>There is, however, an aspect of truth in Bachofen&#8217;s
position, which becomes plain on a closer examination.
To prove this, I must quote a passage from
<i>Das Mutterrecht</i>, as representing, or at least suggesting,
the opinions of those who have argued most
strongly against his theory. When recapitulating
the facts and arguments in favour of accepting
the supremacy of women, he makes this suggestive
statement&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The first state in all cases was that of <i>heta&iuml;rism</i>.
The rule is based upon the right of procreation:
since there is no individual fatherhood, <i>all have
only one father&mdash;the tyrant whose sons and daughters
they all are, and to whom all the property belongs.
From this condition in which the man rules by means
of his rude sexual needs, we rise to that of gyn&aelig;cocracy</i>,
in which there is the dawn of marriage, of
which the strict observance is at first observed by
the woman, not by the man. Weary of always
ministering to the lusts of man, <i>the woman raises
herself by the recognition of her motherhood</i>. Just
as a child is first disciplined by its mother, so are
people by their women. It is only the wife who
can control the man&#8217;s essentially unbridled desires,
and lead him into the paths of well-doing....
<i>While man went abroad on distant forays, the woman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
stayed at home, and was undisputed mistress of the
household.</i> She took arms against her foe, and was
gradually transformed into an Amazon.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p></div>

<p>The italics in the passage are mine, for they bear
directly on what I shall afterwards have to prove:
(1) that mother-right was not the first stage in the
history of the human family; (2) that its existence
is not inconsistent with the patriarchal theory.
Bachofen here suggests a pre-matriarchal period
in which the elementary family-group was founded
on and held together by a common subjection
to the oldest and strongest male. This is the
primordial patriarchal family.</p>

<p>Then come the questions: Can we accept mother-right?
Are there any reasonable causes to explain
the rise of female dominance? Westermarck, in
criticising the matriarchal theory, has said: &#8220;The
inference that &#8216;kinship through females only&#8217;
has everywhere preceded the rise of &#8216;kinship
through males,&#8217; would be warranted only on condition
that the cause, or the causes, to which the
maternal system is owing, could be proved to have
operated universally in the past life of mankind.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
Now, this is what I believe I am able to do. Hence
it has been necessary first to clear the way of the
old errors. Bachofen&#8217;s interpretation is too fanciful
to find acceptance. Will any one hold it as true
that the change came because <i>women willed it</i>?
Surely it is a pure dream of the imagination to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>credit women, at this supposed early stage of society,
with rising up to establish marriage, in a revolt
of purity against sexual licence, and moreover
effecting the change by force of arms! Bachofen
would seem to have been touched with the Puritan
spirit. I am convinced also that he understood
very little of the nature of woman. Conventional
morality has always acted on the side of the man,
not the woman. The clue is, indeed, given in the
woman&#8217;s closer connection with the home, and in
the idea that &#8220;she raises herself by the recognition
of her motherhood.&#8221; But the facts are capable
of an entirely different interpretation. It will be
my aim to give a quite simple, and even commonplace,
explanation of the rise of mother-descent
and mother-right in place of the spiritual hypothesis
of Bachofen.</p>

<p>It will be well, however, to examine further
Bachofen&#8217;s own theory. It is his opinion that the
first Amazonian revolt and period of women&#8217;s rule
was followed by a second movement&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Woman took arms against her foe [<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> man],
and was gradually transformed into an Amazon.
<i>As a rival to the man the Amazon became hostile to
him, and began to withdraw from marriage and from
motherhood. This set limits to the rule of women,
and provoked the punishment of heaven and men.</i>&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>There is a splendid imaginative appeal in this
remarkable passage. Again the italics are mine.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>It is, of course, impossible to accept this statement,
as Bachofen does, as an historical account
of what happened through the agency of women
at the time of which he is treating. Yet, we can
find a suggestion of truth that is eternal. Is there
not here a kind of prophetic foretelling of every
struggle towards readjustment in the relationships
of the two sexes, through all the periods of civilisation,
from the beginning until now? You will see
what I mean. The essential fact for woman&mdash;and
also for man&mdash;is the sense of community with the
race. Neither sex can keep a position apart from
parenthood. Just in so far as the mother and the
father attain to consciousness and responsibility in
their relations to the race do they reach development
and power. Bachofen, as a poet, understood
this; to me, at least, it is the something real that
underlies all the delusion of his work. But I diverge
a little in making these comments.</p>

<p>Again the origin of the change from the first period
of matriarchy is sought by Bachofen in religion.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Each stage of development was marked by
its peculiar religious ideas, produced by the dissatisfaction
with which the dominating idea of the
previous stage was regarded; a dissatisfaction
which led to a disappearance of this condition.&#8221;
&#8220;What was gained by religion, fostering the cause
of women, by assigning a mystical and almost
divine character to motherhood was now lost
through the same cause. The loss came in the
Greek era. Dionysus started the idea of the
divinity of fatherhood; holding the father to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the child&#8217;s true parent, and the mother merely the
nurse.&#8221; In this way, we are asked to believe, the
rights of men arose, the father came to be the chief
parent, the head of the mother and the owner of
the children, and, therefore, the parent through
whom kinship was traced. We learn that, at
first, &#8220;women opposed this new gospel of fatherhood,
and fresh Amazonian risings were the common
feature of their opposition.&#8221; But the resistance
was fruitless. &#8220;Jason put an end to the rule of
the Amazons in Lemnos. Dionysus and Bellerophon
strove together passionately, yet without gaining
a decisive victory, until Apollo, with calm superiority,
finally became the conqueror, and the father
gained the power that before had belonged to the
mother.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p></div>

<p>But before this took place, Bachofen relates yet
another movement, which for a time restored the
early matriarchate. The women, at first opposing,
presently became converts to the Dionysusian
gospel, and were afterwards its warmest supporters.
Motherhood became degraded. Bacchanalian excesses
followed, which led to a return to the ancient
<i>heta&iuml;rism</i>. Bachofen believes that this formed a
fresh basis for a second gyn&aelig;cocracy. He compares
the Amazonian period of these later days with that
in which marriage was first introduced, and finds
that &#8220;the deep religious impulse being absent,
it was destined to fail, and give place to the spiritual
Apollonic conception of fatherhood.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p><p>In Bachofen&#8217;s opinion this triumph of fatherhood
was the final salvation. This is what he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;It was the assertion of fatherhood which
delivered the mind from natural appearances, and
when this was successfully achieved, human existence
was raised above the laws of natural life.
The principal of motherhood is common to all the
spheres of animal life, but man goes beyond this
tie in gaining pre-eminence in the process of procreation,
and thus becomes conscious of his higher
vocation. In the paternal and spiritual principle
he breaks through the bonds of tellurism, and
looks upwards to the higher regions of the cosmos.
Victorious fatherhood thus becomes as distinctly
connected with the heavenly light as prolific
motherhood is with the teeming earth.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p></div>

<p>Here, Bachofen, as is his custom, turns to point
an analogy with the process of nature.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;All the stages of sexual life from Aphrodistic
<i>heta&iuml;rism</i> to the Apollonistic purity of fatherhood,
have their corresponding type in the stages of natural
life, from the wild vegetation of the morass, the
prototype of conjugal motherhood, to the harmonic
law of the Uranian world, to the heavenly light
which, as the <i>flamma non urens</i>, corresponds to the
eternal youth of fatherhood. The connection is so
completely in accordance with law, that the form
taken by the sexual relation in any period may be
inferred from the predominance of one or other of
these universal ideas in the worship of a people.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p></div>

<p>Such, in outline, is Bachofen&#8217;s famous matriarchal
theory. The passages I have quoted, with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>the comments I have ventured to give, make plain
the poetic exaggeration of his view, and sufficiently
prove why his theory no longer gains any considerable
support. To build up a dream-picture of
mother-rule on such foundations was, of necessity,
to let it perish in the dust of scepticism. But is
the downthrow complete? I believe not. A new
structure has to be built up on a new and surer
foundation, and it may yet appear that the prophetic
vision of the dreamer enabled Bachofen to see much
that has escaped the sight of those who have
criticised and rejected his assumption that power
was once in the hands of women.</p>

<p>One great source of confusion has arisen through
the acceptance by the supporters of the matriarchate
of the view that men and women lived
originally in a state of promiscuity. This is the
opinion of Bachofen, of McLennan, of Morgan, and
also of many other authorities, who have believed
maternal descent to be dependent on the uncertainty
of fatherhood. It will be remembered that Mr.
McLennan brought forward his theory almost
simultaneously with that of Bachofen. The basis
of his view is a belief in an ancient communism in
women. He holds that the earliest form of human
societies was the group or horde, and not the family.
He affirms that these groups can have had no idea
of kinship, and that the men would hold their
women, like their other goods, in common, which
is, of course, equal to a general promiscuity. There
he agrees with Bachofen&#8217;s belief in unbridled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
<i>heta&iuml;rism</i>, but a very different explanation is given
of the change which led to regulation, and the
establishment of the maternal family.</p>

<p>According to Mr. McLennan, the primitive group
or horde, though originally without explicit consciousness
of relationships, were yet held together
by a <i>feeling</i> of kin. Such feeling would become
conscious first between the mother and her children,
and, in this way, mother-kin must have been
realised at a very early period. Mr. McLennan
then shows the stages by which the savage would
gradually, by reflection, reach a knowledge of the
other relationships through the mother, sister and
brother relationships, mother&#8217;s brother and mother&#8217;s
sister, and all the degrees of mother-kin, at a time
before the father&#8217;s relation to his children had been
established. The children, though belonging at
first to the group, would remain attached to the
mothers, and the blood-tie established between
them would, as promiscuity gave place to more
regulated sexual relationships, become developed
into a system. All inheritance would pass through
women only, and, in this way, mother-right would
tend to be more or less strongly developed. The
mother would live alone with her children, the only
permanent male members of the family being the
sons, who would be subordinate to her. The
husband would visit the wife, as is the custom
under polyandry, which form of the sexual relationship
Mr. McLennan believes was developed from
promiscuity&mdash;a first step towards individual marriage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Even after the next step was taken, and the
husband came to live with his wife, his position
was that of a visitor in her home, where she would
have the protection of her own kindred. She would
still be the owner of her children, who would bear
her name, and not the father&#8217;s; and the inheritance
of all property would still be in the female line.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>We have here what appears to be a much more
reasonable explanation of mother-kin and mother-right
than that of Bachofen. Yet many have
argued powerfully against it. Westermarck especially,
has shown that belief in an early stage of
promiscuous relationship is altogether untenable.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
It is needless here to enter into proof of this.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> What
matters now is that with the giving up of promiscuity
the whole structure of McLennan&#8217;s theory
falls to pieces. He takes it for granted that at one
period paternity was unrecognised; but this is
very far from being true. The idea of the father&#8217;s
relationship to the child is certainly known among
the peoples who trace descent through the mother;
the system is found frequently where strict monogamy
is practised. Again, Mr. McLennan connects
polyandry with mother-descent, regarding the
custom of plurality of husbands as a development
from promiscuity. Here, too, he has been proved to
be in error. Whatever the causes of the origin of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>polyandry, it has no direct connection with mother-kin,
although it is sometimes practised by peoples
who observe that system.</p>

<p>For myself, I incline to the opinion that the
system by which inheritance passes through the
mother needs no explanation. It was necessarily
(and, as I believe, is still) the <i>natural</i> method of
tracing descent. Moreover, it was adopted as a
matter of course by primitive peoples among whom
property considerations had not arisen. Afterwards
what had started as a habit was retained as
a system. The reasons for naming children after
the mother did not rest on relationship, the earliest
question was not one of kinship, but of association.
Those were counted as related to one another who
dwelt together.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The children lived with the
mother, and therefore, as a matter of course, were
called after her, and not the father, who did not
live in the same home.</p>

<p>All these questions will be understood better as
we proceed with our inquiry. The important thing
to fix in our minds is that mother-kin and mother-right
(contrary to the opinion of McLennan and
others) may very well have arisen quite independently
of dubious fatherhood. It thus becomes
evident that the maternal system offers no evidence
for the hypothesis of promiscuity; we shall
find, in point of fact, that it arose out of the
regulation of the sexual relations, and had no connection
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>with licence. It is necessary to understand
this clearly.</p>

<p>Bachofen is much nearer to what is likely to
have happened in the first stage of the family
than Mr. McLennan, though he also mistakenly
connects the maternal system with unregulated
<i>heta&iuml;rism</i>. Still he suggests (though it would seem
quite unconsciously) the patriarchal hypothesis,
which founds the family first on the brute-force
of the male. Mother-right has been discredited
chiefly, as far as I have been able to find, because
it is impossible to accept, at this early period, sexual
conditions of the friendly ownership of women,
entirely opposed to what was the probable nature
of brute man. At this stage the eldest male in
the family would be the ruler, and he would claim
sexual rights over all the women in the group.
Bachofen postulates a revolt of women to establish
marriage. We have seen that such a supposition,
in the form in which he puts it, is without any
credible foundation. Yet, it is part of my theory
that there was a revolt of women, or rather a combination
of the mothers of the group, which led
to a change in the direction of sexual regulation
and order. But the causes of such revolt, and the
way in which it was accomplished, were, in my
opinion, entirely different from those which Bachofen
supposes. The arguments in support of my view
will be given in the next two chapters.</p>

<h3>DIFFICULTIES AND OBJECTIONS: AN ATTEMPT TO RECONCILE<br />
MOTHER-RIGHT WITH THE PATRIARCHAL
THEORY.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> foundation of the Patriarchal theory is the
jealous sexual nature of the male. This is important;
indeed profoundly significant. The strongest argument
against promiscuity is to be gained from what
we know of this factor of jealousy in the sexual
relationships.</p>

<p>&#8220;The season of love is the season of battle,&#8221; says
Darwin. Such was the law passed on to man from
millions of his ancestral lovers. The action of this
law<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> may be observed at its fiercest intensity among
man&#8217;s pre-human ancestors. Courtship without
combat is rare among all male quadrupeds, and
special offensive and defensive weapons for use
in these love-fights are found; for this is the sex-tragedy
of the natural world, the love-tale red-written
in blood.</p>

<p>This factor of sexual jealousy&mdash;the conflict of
the male for possession of the female&mdash;has not been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>held in sufficient account by those who regard
promiscuity as being the earliest stage in the sexual
relationships. That jealousy is still a powerful
agent even in the most civilised races is a fact on
which it is unnecessary to dwell. This being so,
and since the action of jealousy is so strong in the
animal kingdom, it cannot be supposed to have
been dormant among primitive men. Rather, in
the infancy of his history this passion must have
acted with very great intensity. Thus it becomes
impossible to accept any theory of the community
of women in the earliest stage of the family. For
inevitably such peaceful association would be broken
up by jealous battles among the males, in which
the strongest member would kill or drive away his
rivals.</p>

<p>Great stress is laid, by the supporters of promiscuity,
on the danger that such conflicts must have
been to the growing community. It is, therefore,
held that in order to prevent this check on their
development, it was necessary for the male members
not to give way to jealousy, but to be content with
promiscuous ownership of women. But this is
surely to credit savage man with a control of the
driving jealous instinct that he could not then have
had? What we do not find in the sexual conduct
of men, as they now are, cannot be credited as existing
in the infancy of social life. We fall into many
mistakes in judging these questions of sex; we
under-estimate the strength of love-passion&mdash;the
uncounted ancestral forces dating back to the remote<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
beginnings of life. Doubtless conflicts over the
possession of women were frequent from the beginning
of man&#8217;s history. But these disputes would
not lead to promiscuous intercourse, only to a
change in the tyrant male, who ruled over the women
in the group.</p>

<p>Another fact against a belief in promiscuity is that
the lowest savages known to us are not promiscuous,
in so far as there is no proved case of the sexual
relations being absolutely unregulated. They all
recognise sets of women with whom certain sets of
men can have no marital relations. Again these
savages are very far removed from the state of man&#8217;s
first emergence from the brute, as is proved by their
combination into large and friendly tribes. Such
peaceful aggregation could only have arisen at a much
later period, and after the males had learnt by some
means to control their brute appetites and jealousy
of rivals in that movement towards companionship,
which, first resting in the sexual needs, broadens
out into the social instincts.</p>

<p>For these reasons, then, we conclude that the
theory of a friendly union having existed among
males in the primitive group is the very reverse of
the truth. This question has now been sufficiently
proved. I am thus brought into agreement with
Dr. Westermarck, Mr. Crawley, and Mr. Lang, in
his examination of Mr. Atkinson&#8217;s <i>Primal Law</i>, as
well as with other writers, all of whom have shown
that promiscuity cannot be accepted as a stage in
the early life of the human family.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>I have now to show how far this rejection of
promiscuity affects our position with regard to
mother-descent and mother-right. It is clearly
of vital importance to any theory that its foundations
are secure. One foundation&mdash;that of promiscuity,
on which Bachofen and McLennan, the two
upholders of matriarchy, base their hypothesis&mdash;has
been overthrown. It thus becomes necessary
to approach the question from an altogether different
position. Mother-right must be explained without
any reference to unregulated sexual conduct. I
am thus turned back to examine the opposing theory
to matriarchy, which founds the family on the patriarchal
authority of the father. Nor is this all. What
we must expect a true theory to do is to show conditions
that are applicable not only to special cases,
but in their main features to mankind in general.
I have to prove that such conditions arose in the
primitive patriarchal family as it advanced towards
social aggregation, that would not only make possible,
but, as I believe, would necessitate the power
of the mothers asserting its force in the group-family.
Only when this is done can I hope that a
new belief in mother-right may find acceptance.</p>

<p>The patriarchal theory stated in its simplest
form is this: Primeval man lived in small family
groups, composed of an adult male, and of his wife,
or, if he were powerful, several wives, whom he
jealously guarded from the sexual advances of all
other males. In such a group the father is the
chief or patriarch as long as he lives, and the family<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
is held together by their common subjection to him.
As for the children, the daughters as soon as they
grow up are added to his wives, while the sons are
driven out from the home at the time they reach an
age to be dangerous as sexual rivals to their father.
The important thing to note is that <i>in each group
there would be only one adult polygamous male, with
many women of different ages and young children</i>.
I shall return to this later. Such is the marked difference
in the position of the two sexes&mdash;the solitary
jealously unsocial father and the united mothers.
I can but wonder how its significance has escaped
the attention of the many inquirers, who have sought
the truth in this matter. Probably the explanation
is to be found in this: they have been interested
mainly in one side of the family&mdash;the male side; I
am interested in the other side&mdash;in the women
members of the group. The position of women has
seemed of primary importance to very few. Bachofen
is almost alone in placing this question first,
and his mystical far-fetched hypothesis has failed
to find acceptance.</p>

<p>Let me now, in order to make the position clearer,
continue a rough grouping of the supposed conditions
in this primordial family, with all its members in
subjection to the common father. It may be argued
that we can know nothing at all about the family
and the position of the two sexes at this brute period.
This is true. The conditions are, of course, conjectural,
and any suggested conclusions to be drawn
from them must be still more so. Yet some hypothesis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
must be risked as a starting-point for any
theory that attempts to go so far back in the stream
of time.</p>

<p>We may suppose, then, that mankind aboriginally
lived in small families in much the same way as the
great monkeys: we see the same conditions, for
instance, among the families of gorillas, where the
group never becomes large. The male leader will
not endure the rivalry of the young males, and as
soon as they grow up a contest takes place, and the
strongest and eldest male, by killing or driving out
the others, maintains his position as the tyrant
head of the family.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>This may be taken as a picture of the human brute-family.
It is clear that the relation of the father
to the other group members was not one of kinship,
but of power. &#8220;Every female in my crowd is
my property,&#8221; says&mdash;or feels&mdash;Mr. Atkinson&#8217;s patriarchal
anthropoid, &#8220;and the patriarch gives expression
to his sentiment with teeth and claws, if
he has not yet learned to double up his fist with a
stone in it. These were early days.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>We may conclude that there would be many
of these groups, each with a male head, his wives and
adult daughters, and children of both sexes. It is
probable that they lived a nomadic life, finding a
temporary home in a cave, rock, or tree-shelter,
in some place where the supply of food was plentiful.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>The area of their wanderings would be fixed by the
existence of other groups; for such groups would
almost certainly be mutually hostile to each other,
watchfully resenting any intrusion on their own feeding
ground. A further, and more powerful, cause
of hostility would arise from the sexual antagonism
of the males. Around each group would be the
band of exiled sons, haunting their former hearth-homes,
and forming a constant element of danger
to the solitary paternal tyrant. This I take to be
important as we shall presently see. For, the most
urgent necessity of these young men, after the need
for food, must have been to obtain wives. This
could be done only by capturing women from one
or other of the groups. The difficulties attending
such captures must have been great. It is, therefore,
probable the young men at first kept together,
sharing their wives in polyandrous union. But this
condition would not continue, the group thus formed
would inevitably break up at the adult stage under
the influence of jealousy; the captured wives would
be fought for and carried off by the strongest males
to form fresh groups.</p>

<p>In this matter I have given the opinion of Mr.
Atkinson and Mr. Lang. They hold that no permanent
peaceful union could have been maintained
among the groups of young men and their captive
wives. Mr. Atkinson gives the reason&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Their unity could only endure as long as the
youthfulness of the members necessitated union
for protection, and their immaturity prevented the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
full play of sexual passion.&#8221; And again: &#8220;The
necessary Primal Law which alone could determine
peace within a family circle by recognising a
<i>distinction between female and male</i> (the indispensable
antecedent to a definition of marital rights)
could never have arisen in such a body. It follows
if such a law was ever evoked, it must have been from
<i>within the only other assembly in existence</i>, viz. that
headed by the solitary polygamous patriarch.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p></div>

<p>Whether Mr. Atkinson is right I shall not attempt
to say; the point is one on which I hesitate a decided
opinion; but as this view affords support to my
own theory I shall accept it.</p>

<p>Now, to consider the bearing of this on our present
inquiry. So far I have followed very closely the
family group gathered around the patriarchal tyrant,
under the conditions given by Mr. Atkinson and
Mr. Lang, in <i>Social Origins and Primal Law</i>. It
will not, I think, have escaped the notice of the reader
that very little has been said about the women and
their children. There is no hint at all that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>women must have lived a life of their own, different
in its conditions from that of the men. The female
members, it would seem, have been taken for granted
and not considered, except in so far as their presence
is necessary to excite the jealous sexual combats
of the males. This seems to be very instructive.
The idea of the subjection of all females to the solitary
male has been accepted without question.
But the group consisted of <i>many women and only
one adult man</i>. Yet in spite of this, the man is held
to be the essential member; all the family obey
him. His wife (or wives) and his daughters, though
necessary to his pleasure as also to continue the group,
are regarded as otherwise unimportant, in fact,
mere property possessions to him. Now, I am very
sure the rights these group-women must have held
have been greatly underrated, and the neglect to
recognise this has led, I think, to many mistakes.
I am willing to accept the authority of the polygamous
patriarch&mdash;within limits. But it seems
probable, as I shall shortly indicate, that a predominant
influence in the domestic life is to be ascribed
to the women, and, therefore, &#8220;the movement
towards peace within the group circle&#8221; must be
looked for as a result from the feminine side of the
family, rather than from the male side. There is
still another point: I maintain that precisely through
the concentration of the male ruler on the sexual
subjection of his females, conditions must have
arisen, affecting the conduct and character of the
women: conditions, moreover, that would bring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
them inevitably more and more into a position
of power.</p>

<p>It remains for me to suggest what I believe these
conditions to have been. Meanwhile let us keep one
fact steadily before our minds. The fierce sexual
jealousy of the males had by some means to be
controlled. It is evident that the way towards
social progress could be found only by the peaceful
aggregation of these solitary hostile groups; and
this could not be done without breaking down the
rule that strength and seniority in the male conferred
upon him marital right over all the females. In
other words, the tyrant patriarch had in some way
to learn to tolerate the presence of other adult
males on friendly terms within his own group.
We have to find how this first, but momentous,
step in social progress was taken.</p>

<p>Let us concentrate now our attention on the
domestic life of the women. And first we must
examine more carefully the exact conditions that
we may suppose to have existed in these hostile
groups. The father is the tyrant of the band&mdash;an
egoist. Any protection he affords the family is in
his own interests, he is chief much more than father.
His sons he drives away as soon as they are old enough
to give him any trouble; his daughters he adds to his
harem. We may conceive that the domination
of his sexual jealousy must have chiefly occupied
his time and his attention. It is probable that he
was fed by his women; at least it seems certain
that he cannot have provided food for them and for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
all the children of the group. Sex must have been
uninterruptedly interesting to him. In the first
place he had to capture his wife, or wives, then he
had to fight for the right of sole possession. Afterwards
he had to guard his women, especially his
daughters, from being carried off, in their turn,
by younger males, his deadly rivals, who, exiled
by sexual jealousy from his own and the other similar
hearth-homes, would come, with each returning year,
more and more to be feared. An ever-recurring
and growing terror would dog each step of the
solitary paternal despot, and necessitate an unceasing
watchfulness against danger, and even an
anticipation of death. For when old age, or sickness
decreased his power of holding his own,
then the tables would be turned, and the younger
men, so hardly oppressed, would raise their hands
against him in parricidal strife.</p>

<p>You will see what all this strife suggests&mdash;the
unstable and adventitious relation of the man to the
social hearth-group. Such conditions of antagonism
of each male against every other male must favour
the assumption that no advance in peace&mdash;on which
alone all future progress depended&mdash;could have
come from the patriarchs. Jealousy forced them
into unsocial conduct.</p>

<p>But advance by peace to progress was by some
means to be made. I believe that the way was
opened up by women.</p>

<p>I hasten to add, however, in case I am mistaken
here, that I am very far from wishing to set up any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
claim of superiority for savage woman over savage
man. The momentous change was not, indeed,
the result of any higher spiritual quality in the
female, nor was it a religious movement, as is the
beautiful dream of Bachofen. I do not think we
can credit &#8220;a movement&#8221; as having taken place
at all, rather the change arose gradually, inevitably,
and quite simply. To postulate a conscious movement
towards progress organised by women is surely
absurd. Human nature does not start on any new
line of conduct voluntarily, rather it is forced into
it in connection with the conditions of life. Just as
savage man was driven into unsocial conduct, so,
as I shall try to show, savage woman was led by
the same conditions acting in an opposite direction,
into social conduct.</p>

<p>My own thought was drawn first to this conclusion
by noting the behaviour of a band of female turkeys
with their young. It was a year ago. I was staying
in a Sussex village, and near by my home was
the meadow of a farm in which families of young
turkeys were being reared. Here I often sat; and
one day it chanced that I was reading <i>Social Origins
and Primal Law</i>. I had reached the chapter on
&#8220;Man in the Brutal Stage,&#8221; in which Mr. Atkinson
gives the supposed facts of brute man, and the action
of his jealousy in the family group. I was very much
impressed; my reason told me that what the author
stated so well was probably right. Such sexually
jealous conduct on the part of savage man was likely
to be true; it was much easier to accept this than the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
state of promiscuous intercourse, with its friendly
communism in women, in which I had hitherto
believed. I really was very much disturbed. For I
was still unshaken in my belief in mother-right.
How were the two theories to be reconciled?</p>

<p>Often it is a small thing that points to the way
for which one is seeking. All at once my little boy,
who had been playing in the field, called out, &#8220;Oh,
look at the Gobble-gobble,&#8221;&mdash;the name by which
he called the male-turkey. The cock, his great
tail spread, his throat swelling, was swaggering
across the field, making an immense amount of
noisy disturbance. A group of females and young
birds, many of them almost full grown, were near
to where we were sitting; they had been rooting
about in the ground getting their food. Their fear
at the approach of the strutting male was manifest.
All the band gathered together, with the young in
the centre, led and flanked by the mothers. As
the male continued to advance upon them they
retreated further and further, and finally took
harbour in a barn. Here the swaggerer tried to
follow them, but the rear females turned and faced
him and drove him off.</p>

<p>I had found the clue that I was seeking. All
I had been reading now had a clear meaning for
me. In my delight, I laughed aloud. I saw the
egoism of the solitary male; I knew the meaning
of the females&#8217; retreat; they were guarding the
young from the feared attacks of the father. I
realised how the male&#8217;s unsocial conduct towards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
his offspring had forced the females to unite with
one another. The cock&#8217;s strength, the gorgeous
display of sex-charms, were powerless before this
peaceful combination. He was alone, a tyrant&mdash;the
destroyer of the family. But I saw, too, that his
polygamous jealousy served as a means to the end
of advance in progress. It was the male&#8217;s non-social
conduct that had forced social conduct upon
the females. And I understood that the patriarchal
tyrant was just the one thing I had been looking for.
My belief in mother-power had gained a new and,
as I felt then in the first delight of that discovery,
and as I still feel, a much surer, because a simpler
and more natural foundation.</p>

<p>Having now defined my position, and having
related how such conviction came to me, let me
proceed to examine the causes that would lead to the
assertion of women&#8217;s power, in the aboriginal family
group. From what has been said, the following
conditions acting on the women, may, it is submitted,
be fairly deduced.</p>

<div class="blockquot2"><p>1. In the group, which comprised the mothers,
the adult daughters, and the young of both
sexes, the women would live on terms of
association as friendly hearth-mates.</p>

<p>2. The strongest factor in this association would
arise from the dependence of the children
upon their mothers; a dependence that was
of much longer duration than among the
animals, on account of the pre-eminent helplessness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
of the human child, which entailed
a more prolonged infancy.</p>

<p>3. The women and their children would form
the group, to which the father was attached
by his sexual needs, but remained always a
member apart&mdash;a kind of jealous fighting
specialisation.</p>

<p>4. The temporary hearth-home would be the shelter
of the women; and it was under this shelter
that children were born and the group accumulated
its members. Whether cave, or
hollow tree, or some frail shelter, the home
must have belonged to the women.</p>

<p>5. And this state would necessarily attach the
mothers to the home, much more closely than
the father, whose desire lay in the opposite
direction of disrupting the home. Moreover
this attachment always would be present
and acting on the female children, who,
unless captured, would remain with the
mothers, while it could never arise in the
case of the sons, whose fate was to be driven
from the home. Such conditions must, as
time went on, have profoundly modified the
women&#8217;s outlook, bending their desires to a
steady, settled life, conditions under which
alone the germ of social organisation could
develop.</p>

<p>6. Again, the daily search for the daily food must
have been undertaken chiefly by the women.
For it is impossible that one man, however<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
skilful a hunter, could have fed all the female
members and children of the group. We
may conceive that his attention and his time
must have been occupied largely in fighting
his rivals; while much of his strength, as
sole progenitor, must have been expended in
sex. It is therefore probable that frequently
the patriarch was dependent on the food
activities of his women.</p>

<p>7. The mothers, their inventive faculties quickened
by the stress of child-bearing and child-rearing,
would learn to convert to their own
uses the most available portion of their
environment. It would be under the attention
of the women that plants were first
utilised for food. Seeds would be beaten
out, roots and tubers dug for, and nuts and
fruits gathered in their season and stored
for use. Birds would have to be snared,
shell-fish and fish would be caught; while,
at a later period, animals would be tamed for
service. Primitive domestic vessels to hold
and to carry water, baskets to store the food
supplies would have to be made. Clothes
for protection against the cold would come
to be fashioned. All the faculties of the
women, in exercises that would lead to the
development of every part of their bodies,
would be called into play by the work of
satisfying the physical needs of the group.</p>

<p>8. This interest and providence for the family<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
would certainly have its effect on the development
of the women. The formation of character
is largely a matter of attention, and the
attention of the mothers being fixed on the
supply of the necessary food, doubtless often
difficult to obtain, their energies would be
driven into productive activities, much more
than in the case of the father, whose attention
was fixed upon himself.</p>

<p>9. In all these numerous activities the women of
each group would work together. And
through this co-operation must have resulted
the assertion of the women&#8217;s power, as the
directors and organisers of industrial occupations.
As the group slowly advanced in
progress, such power increasing would raise
the women&#8217;s position; the mothers would
establish themselves permanently as of essential
value in the family, not only as the givers
of life, but as the chief providers of the food
essential to the preservation of the life of
its members.</p>

<p>10. And a further result would follow in the treatment
by the male of this new order. The
women by obtaining and preparing food
would gain an economic value. Wives would
become to the patriarch a source of riches,
indispensable to him, not only on account of
his sex needs, but on account of the more
persistent need of food. Thus the more
women he possessed the greater would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
his own comfort, and the physical prosperity
of the group. The women would become of
ever greater importance, and the economic
power that they thus acquired would more
and more favourably influence their position.</p>

<p>11. There is one other matter in this connection. The
greater number of women in the group the
stronger would become their power of combination.
I attach great importance to this.
Working together for the welfare of all, the
social motive would grow stronger in women,
so that necessarily they would come to consider
the collective interests of the group.
Can it be credited that such conditions
could have acted upon the patriarch, whose
conduct would still be inspired by individual
appetite and selfish inclinations? I maintain
such a view to be impossible.</p>

<p>12. Another advantage, I think, would arise for
women out of the male&#8217;s jealous tyranny in
the sexual relationship. Such an idea may
appear strange, if we think only of the subjection
of the females to the brute-appetite
of the patriarch. Yet there is another side.
The women must have gained freedom by
being less occupied with sex passions, and
also from being less jealously interested in
the man than he was in them. It may be urged
that the women would be jealous of each
other. I do not think this could have been.
Jealousy has its roots in the consciousness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of possession, and is only aroused through fear
of loss. This could not have acted with any
great power among the women in the patriarchal
group. Their interest of possession
in sex must have been less acute in consciousness
than the interest of the male.
Doubtless the woman would be attracted
by the male&#8217;s courageous action in fighting
his rivals for possession of her, but when the
rival was the woman&#8217;s son such attraction
would come into strong conflict with the
deeper maternal instinct.</p>

<p>13. From the standpoint of physical strength, the
patriarch was the master, the tyrant ruler
of the group, who, doubtless, often was brutal
enough. But the women, leading an independent
life to some extent, and with their
mental ingenuity developed by the conditions
of their life, would learn, I believe, to outwit
their master by passive united resistance.
They would come to utilise their sex charms
as an accessory of success. Thus the unceasing
sexual preoccupation of the male,
with the emotional dependence it entailed
on the females, must, I would suggest, have
given women an immense advantage. If
I am right here, the patriarch would be in
the power of his women, much more surely
than they would be in his power.</p>

<p>14. Again, an antagonism must have arisen between
the despot father and his women, in particular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
with his daughters, forced to submit to his
brute-passions. I confess I find grave difficulty
in reconciling the view that the group-daughters
would willingly become the wives
of their father. I cannot conceive them
without some power to exercise that choice
in love, which is the right of the female
throughout nature. There is great insistence
by Mr. Atkinson, and all who have written
on the subject, on the sexual passions of
the males, while the desires of the women
are not considered at all. Apparently they
are held to have had none! This affords
yet another instance of the strange concentration
on the male side of the family. It is taken
for granted, for instance, that in every case
the young men, when driven from their home,
had to capture their wives from other groups.
I would suggest that often the capture was
aided by the woman herself; she may even
have escaped from the hearth-home in her
desire to find a partner, preferring the rule
of a young tyrant to an old one, who moreover
was her father. I believe, too, that the wives
and mothers must frequently have asserted
their will in rebellion. I picture, indeed,
these savage women ever striving for more
privileges, and step by step advancing through
peaceful combination to power.</p>

<p>15. I desire also to maintain that all I have here
suggested finds support from what is known<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
of the position of women among primitive
peoples; and I may add also, from the
character of women to-day.</p></div>

<p>Now I have summarised briefly what seem to me
the probable conditions of the women&#8217;s daily life
in these earliest groups. I have attempted to show
how the sexual jealousy, which acted for the destruction
of the mutually hostile male members, would
necessitate for the women conditions in many ways
favourable; conditions of union in which lay the
beginnings of peace and order. What we have to
fix in our thoughts is the significant fact of the sociability
of the women&#8217;s lives in contrast with the solitude
of the jealous sire, watchfully resenting the
intrusion of all other males. Such conditions cannot
have failed to domesticate the women, and urged
them forward to the work that was still to be done
in domesticating man. During the development
of the family, we may expect that the patriarch
will seek to hold his rights, and that the women will
exert their influence more and more in breaking these
down; and this is precisely what we do find, as
I presently shall show.</p>

<p>One point further. It may, of course, be urged
that all I am affirming for women in this far back
beginning is but a process of ingenious guessing.
Such criticism is just. But I am speaking of conditions
at a time when conjecture is necessary. I
venture to say that my suggestions are in accord
with what is likely to have happened. Moreover,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
many difficulties will be made clearer if these guesses
are accepted. I believe that here in the earliest
patriarchal stage we have already the germs of the
maternal family. All the chances for success in
power rested with the united mothers, rather than
with the solitary father. Assuredly the jealous
patriarchs paid a heavy price for their sexual
domination.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></h2>

<h3>DEVELOPMENT IN THE PATRIARCHAL FAMILY<br />
AND THE RISE OF MOTHER-POWER</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> essential question, now, is how these small
hostile groups were brought by association to expand
into larger groups. In what way was the sexual
monopoly of the male ruler first curbed, and afterwards
broken down, for only by this being done
could peace be gained? However advantageous
the habits of the patriarch may have been for
himself, they were directly opposed to progress.
Jealousy depends on the failure to recognise the
rights of others. This sexual egoism, by which one
man through his strength and seniority held marital
rights over all the females of his group, had to be
struck at its roots. In other words, the solitary
despot had to learn to tolerate the association of
other adult males.</p>

<p>How was this happy change to be brought about?
Social qualities are surely developed in the character
by union with one&#8217;s fellow beings. From what
has been stated, it seems certain that it was in the
interests of the women to consolidate the family,
and by means of association to establish their own
power. Jealousy is an absolutely non-social quality.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Regarding its influence, it is certainly absurd to
believe any voluntary association to have been
possible among the males of the hostile patriarchal
groups; to credit this is to give the lie to the entire
theory. We are driven, therefore, to seek for the
beginnings of social conduct among the women.
I have suggested the conditions forcing them into
combination with one another against the tyranny
of the patriarch. I have now to show how these
causes, continually acting, brought the women step
by step into a position of authority and power.
There is, however, no suggestion of a spiritual
revolt on the part of women. I do not wish to set
up any claim for, because I do not believe in, the
superiority of one sex over the other sex. Character
is determined by the conditions of living. If, as I
conceive, progress came through savage women,
rather than through savage men, it was because
the conditions were really more favourable to them,
and drove them on in the right path. However
strange it may appear, their sexual subjection to
the fierce jealousy of the patriarch acted as a means
to an end in advancing peace.</p>

<p>The strongest force of union between the women
would grow out of the consciousness of an ever-threatening
and common danger. Not only had
the young to be fed and cared for during infancy
and childhood, but, as they grew in years, they
had to be guarded from the father, whose relation
to his offspring was that of an enemy. It has been
seen how the sons were banished at puberty from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
family group to maintain the patriarch&#8217;s marital
rights. Doubtless the strength of maternal love gained
in intensity through the many failures in conflicts,
that must have taken place with the tyrant fathers.
Would not this community of suffering tend to
force the women to unite with one another, at each
renewed banishment of their sons? May they not,
after the banishment, have assisted their sons in
the capture of their wives? I think it must be
allowed that this is possible. And there is another
point to notice. The exiled sons and their captured
wives would each have a mother in the groups they
had left. May it not be conceived that, as time
brought progress in intelligence, some friendly
communication might have been established between
group and group, in defiance of the jealous guardianship
of the patriarchs? Thus, through the danger,
ever to be feared in every family, there might open
up a way by sympathy to a possible future union.</p>

<p>It is part of my supposition that every movement
towards friendship must have arisen among the
women. This is no fanciful idea of my own. Mr.
Atkinson, one of the strongest supporters of the
patriarchal theory, agrees with this view, though
he does not seem to see its origin, and does not
follow up its deep suggestion. By him the movement
in advance is narrowed to a single issue of
peace between the father and his sons, but this great
step is credited to the influence of the mothers.
I must quote the passages that refer to this&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;At the renewed banishment of each of her male
progeny by the jealous patriarch, the mother&#8217;s
feelings and instincts would be increasingly lacerated
and outraged. Her agonised efforts to retain at
least her last and youngest would be even stronger
than with her first born. It is exceedingly important
to observe that her chances of success in this case
would be much greater. When this last and dearest
son approached adolescence, it is not difficult to
perceive that the patriarch must have reached an
age when the fire of desire may have become somewhat
dull, whilst, again, his harem, from the presence
of numerous adult daughters, would be increased
to an extent that might have overtaxed his once
more active powers. Given some such rather exceptional
situation, where a happy opportunity in
superlative mother love wrestled with a for once
satiated paternal appetite in desire, we may here
discern a possible key of the sociological problem
which occupies us, and which consisted in a conjunction
within one group of two adult males.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>In the next paragraph the author presents the
situation which in this way might have arisen&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;We must conceive that, in the march of the
centuries, on some fateful day, the bloody tragedy
in the last act of the familiar drama was avoided,
and the edict of exile or death left unpronounced.
<i>Pure maternal love triumphed over the demons of lust
and jealousy.</i> A mother succeeded in keeping by
her side a male child, and thus, by a strange coincidence,
that father and son, who, amongst all
mammals, had been the most deadly enemies, were
now the first to join hands. So portentous an
alliance might well bring the world to their feet.
The family would now present for the first time, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
until then unknown spectacle of the inclusion within
a domestic circle, and amidst its component females,
of an adolescent male youth. It must, however, be
admitted that such an event, at such an epoch,
demanded imperatively very exceptional qualities,
both physiological and psychological, in the primitive
agents. The new happy ending to that old-world
drama which had run so long through blood
and tears, was an innovation requiring very unusually
gifted actors. How many failures had doubtless
taken place in its rehearsal during the centuries,
with less able or happy interpreters!&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Mr. Atkinson supposes that success in the new
experiment &#8220;was rendered possible by the rise of
new powers in nascent man.&#8221; Here I do not follow
him. &#8220;The germ of altruism,&#8221; which he sees as
&#8220;already having risen to make its force felt&#8221; was,
indeed, as he says &#8220;an important factor.&#8221; But is it
credible that this altruism existed in the father? I can
conceive him being won over through his own emotional
dependence on some specially pleasing woman;
he may well have had favourites among his wives.
I cannot accept &#8220;altruism&#8221; as a reason for his
conduct, under conditions acting in an exact opposite
way in fostering and increasing egoism. Much more
probable is the supposition that he &#8220;must have
reached the age when the fire of desire had become
somewhat dulled.&#8221;</p>

<p>I must also take exception to a further statement
of Mr. Atkinson, &#8220;that with such prolonged infancy
there had been opportunity for the development of
paternal philoprogenitiveness.&#8221; And again: &#8220;It is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
evident that such long-continued presence of sons
could but result in a certain mutual sympathy,
however inevitable the eventual exile.&#8221; It is unnecessary
for me to labour this question. I may,
however, point out, that the identical conditions of
the family among the anthropoid apes (on whom
Mr. Atkinson bases his patriarchy) do not afford
any proof of paternal altruism. The polygamous
jealous father never enters into friendly union with
the other males. He is strong and sexually beautiful,
but he is never social in his domestic conduct.
He is the tyrant in the family, and the young are
guarded from his attacks by the mothers. With
the mothers there is protection and safety, with
the father ownership. The whole argument of the
patriarchal theory is based on the fact of the jealous
conduct of the male. Driven to live in solitary
enmity, the patriarch could not voluntarily tolerate
the presence of a rival, if he was to maintain his
position as ruler. It is impossible to get away from
this. Mr. Atkinson comes very near to this essential
truth, when he suggests (though he does not fully
acknowledge) that the first step in social development
came through the mother&#8217;s love for her
child; but at once he turns aside from this, drawn,
I think unconsciously, to the common opinion of
the complete subjection of the females to the
male, an opinion always making it difficult to
accept the initiative in reform as coming from the
woman.</p>

<p>The exclusive and persisting idea of Mr. Atkinson&#8217;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
theory is to establish the action of what he calls
&#8220;the primal law.&#8221; Only by limiting and defining
the marital rights of the males over the females
could advancement be gained. Until this was done
these small hostile groups could not become larger,
and expand into the clan or tribe.</p>

<p>I must follow this question a little although it
leads us aside from the immediate subject of my
own inquiry. The first step in progress has been
taken; by the triumph of maternal love, an adult
male son is now included in the group. We must
conceive that this victory, having once been gained
by one mother, would be repeated by other mothers.
Afterwards, as time went on, the advantage in
strength gained to the group by this increase in
their male members, would tend to encourage the
custom. One may reasonably assume that it
became established as a habit in each group that
once had taken the first step. Father and sons,
for so long enemies, now enter on a truce.</p>

<p>It must not, however, be concluded that sexual
peace followed this new order. It is part of Mr.
Atkinson&#8217;s theory that the patriarch&#8217;s sexual
jealousy would not be broken down by his tolerance
of the presence of his sons. Peace could be maintained
only so long as the intruders respected his
marital rights. Under this condition, all the group
women, as they all belonged to the patriarch,
would be taboo to the young men; otherwise there
would be a fight, and the offending son would be
driven into exile. Doubtless this frequently happened,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
but the advantages gained by union would
tend to prevent the danger. Some means of preserving
sexual peace within the group certainly
would come to be established. &#8220;For the first time,&#8221;
as Mr. Atkinson points out, &#8220;we encounter the
factor which is to be the leading power in future
metamorphosis, i.&nbsp;e. <i>an explicit distinction between
female and female as such</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Through this bar placed on the female members
within the family circle, the sons, who remained in
peace, would be forced to continue the practice of
capturing their wives, and would bring in women
to live with them from other groups. It is assumed
that these captures were in all cases hostile. I have
given my reasons for disagreeing with this view. I
hold that the young women may have been glad
to have been taken by the young men, and most
probably assisted them, in a surely not unnatural
desire to escape from their tyrant fathers. I
really cannot credit such continued sexual subjection
on the part of the group-daughters, an opinion
which arises, I am certain, from the curious misconception
of the passivity of the human female in
love.</p>

<p>I do not wish to conceal that my conjecture of
an active part having been taken by the women,
both in their captures and also in all the relationships
of the family, is opposed to the great majority of
learned opinion. The reason for this already has
been suggested. Almost invariably the writers on
these questions are men, and there is, I imagine,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
a certain blindness in their view. I am convinced
that from the earliest beginnings of the human
family women have exercised a much stronger and
more direct influence than is usually believed. All
the movements towards regulation and progress, so
ingeniously worked out by Mr. Atkinson, are easier
to credit if we accept the initiative as having come
from the group-mothers. I have an inward conviction
of an unchanging law between the two sexes,
and though I cannot here attempt to give any proof,
it seems to me, we can always trace <i>the absorption
by the male of female ideas</i>. The man accepts what
the woman brings forward, and then assumes the
control, believing he is the originator of her ideas.
Take this case of capture: If, as I suggest, the young
women assisted or even took the initiative in their
own captures, they would very plainly not be willing
to allow sexual relationships with another hoary
patriarch. I would urge that here again it was by
the action of the young women, rather than the
young men, that the new order was established.
But this is a small matter. If I am right, the communal
living and common danger among the women
would powerfully bind them together in union, and
sever them from the male rulers. Once this is
granted, it follows that social consciousness in the
women must have been stronger than in the solitary
males. Then there can be no possible doubt of
the part taken by women in the slow advancement
of the group by regulation to social peace. Moreover,
I believe, that confirmation of what is here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
claimed for women will be found (as will appear
in the later part of my inquiry) in many social
habits among existing primitive peoples, who still
live under the favourable conditions of the maternal
family; habits that suggest a long evolutionary
process, and that can be explained only if they have
arisen in a very remote beginning. But enough on
this subject has now been said.</p>

<p>Many interesting questions arise from the action
of Mr. Atkinson&#8217;s &#8220;primal law.&#8221; His theory offers
a solution of the much-debated question of the
origin of exogamy,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> the term used first by Mr.
McLennan, in <i>Primitive Marriage</i>, for the rule which
prohibited sexual relationships within the group
limit. Continence imposed by the patriarch on his
sons within the group, as a condition of his tolerance
of their presence, necessarily and logically entailed
marriage without, with women from some other
group. This explanation of exogamy is so simple
that it seems likely to be true. It is much more
reasonable than any of the numerous other theories
that have been brought forward. Mr. McLennan,
for instance, suggests that the custom arose through
a scarcity of females, owing to the widespread
practice of female infanticide. This can hardly be
accepted, for such conditions, where they exist,
would arise at a much later period. Even less
likely is the theory of Dr. Westermarck, who explains
exogamy as arising from &#8220;an instinct against
marriage of near kin.&#8221; But we have no proof of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>the existence of any such instinct.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Mr. Crawley&#8217;s
view is similar: he connects the custom with the
idea of sexual taboo, which makes certain marriages
a deadly sin. It is evident that these causes could
not have operated with the brute patriarch. One
great point in favour of Mr. Atkinson&#8217;s view is that
it takes us so much further back. By it exogamy
as a custom must have been much earlier than
totemism, as at this stage the different group-families
would not be distinguished by totem names; but
its action as a law would become much stronger
when reinforced by the totem superstitions, and
would become fixed in rigid sexual taboos.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The
strongest of these taboos is the avoidance between
brothers and sisters; this is Mr. Atkinson&#8217;s <i>primal
law</i>. It is a law that is still a working factor among
barbarous races, and entails restrictions and avoidances
of the most binding nature.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I have not space to write even
briefly on this important and deeply interesting
subject. A right understanding of the whole question
of sexual taboos, with the complicated totem
superstitions on which they are based, is very
necessary to any inquiry into the position of women.
But to do this I should have to write another book.
All I can say is this: these avoidances had in their
origin no connection with the relative power of
the two sexes; nor do I believe it can be proved
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>that they were established by men rather than
by women. They arose quite naturally, out of the
necessity for regulation as a condition of peace.</p>

<p>Let me give one example that will serve to show
how easily mistakes may arise. One of these rules,
common among primitive peoples, prevents the
women from eating with the men. This is often considered
as a proof of the inferior position of the women,
whereas it proves nothing of the kind. It is just one
instance out of many numerous laws of avoidance
between wife and husband, sister and brother,
mother and son, and, indeed, between all relations
in the family, which are part of the general rule to
restrict sexual familiarity between the two sexes,
set up at a time when moral restraints upon desire
could act but feebly. It was only much later that
these sexual taboos came to be fixed as superstitions,
that with unbreakable fetters bound the freedom
of women.</p>

<p>Here, indeed, are facts causing us to think. We
perceive how old and strongly rooted are many
customs from which to-day we are fighting to escape;
customs of separation between women and men,
which, with appalling conservatism, have descended
through the ages. Will they ever be broken down?
I do not know. These questions are not considered
in adequate fashion; often we are ignorant of the
deep forces driving the sexes into situations of
antagonism. Clearly these primitive avoidances
shed strong light on the sexual problems of our day.
The subject is one of profound interest. I wish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
that it were possible to follow it, but all this lies
outside the limit set to my inquiry, and already
I have been led far from the patriarchal family.</p>

<p>The group has advanced in progress, and now has
many features in common with existing savage
peoples. The friendly conjunction of the father
and his sons has established peace. Exogamy has
begun to be practised; and the family in this way
has been increased not only by the presence of the
group-sons, but by their captured wives. We have
seen that this would necessitate certain rules of
sexual avoidance; thus the patriarch still holds
marital rights over his wives and the group-daughters,
while the captured women are sacred to the group-sons.</p>

<p>There is now a further important change to consider.
Again the rights of the patriarch have to
be restricted; a bar has to be raised to prevent his
adding his daughters to his wives. Only by overcoming
this habit of paternal incest can further
social evolution become possible.</p>

<p>On this question I shall give the explanation of
Mr. Atkinson; and it is with real regret that the
limit of my space makes it impossible to quote in
full his own words.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The change came by <i>the
entrance of outside suitors as husbands for the daughters
and their acceptance as group-members</i>.</p>

<p>At this point a difficulty once again arises. By
what means was the patriarch brought to accept
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>the presence of these young intruders, thus usurping
his sexual rights over his daughters? Mr. Atkinson
believes this could not have taken place during the
life of the patriarch. &#8220;The initiative in change
must have arisen irrespective of him, or without
his presence.&#8221; Here Mr. Atkinson appears to me
to fall into error, as once more he neglects to consider
the effect of the young women&#8217;s own desires.
I hold that, by this time, the group-daughters,
supported by their mothers, must have been strong
enough to outwit their father (whose authority
already had been weakened), if not openly, then by
deceiving him. They would now see their brothers
living with young wives. Is it credible, I ask, that
they would remain content with the sexual embraces
of their father?</p>

<p>In this connection it is of interest to note the
opposition sometimes offered by young females to
the advances of an old male among the families of
monkeys. I have received quite recently an account
of such a case in a letter from my friend, Max Henry
Ferrass, formerly Inspector of Schools in India,
and the author of a valuable work on Burmah.
This is what he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;I once was able to observe a herd of common
long-tailed monkeys of the Indian plains at play
on a sandbank in a river. There were about fifty
of all ages. There was one great bully among them
who looked double the size of the average adult&mdash;and
must have been double the weight, at any rate&mdash;whose
sport was to chase the young females.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
They, knowing his game, fled before him, but he
caught them readily. But before he could have
his will of any, she would bound from his grasp
as if stung, and always escape, as this sudden spurt
of energy was more than he could control.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Here we have a clear instance in which the young
females escape from the thraldom of the male ruler
of the horde. The power with which Mr. Atkinson
endows his human patriarch seems to me quite
incredible. I have asserted again and again that
the consolidation of the group-circle was of much
greater importance to the women than to the men.
Now this surely points to the acceptance of the view
that the regulation of the brute sexual appetite was
initiated by the women. Thereby, it may be pointed
out, their action merely resembles womankind in any
stage from the lowest degree of savagery to the
highest stage of civilisation.</p>

<p>Moreover, there is further proof that points
strongly to the acceptance of this view, that, the
new departure, by which young husbands came into
the group, was brought about by the women, in
opposition to the knowledge and will of the patriarch.
There exists a common custom among primitive
tribes, which affords evidence of these outside suitors
having visited their brides in secret. I refer to
the practice by which intercourse between the husband
and wife is carried on clandestinely by night.
This is one of the earliest forms of marriage, and,
further, it is closely connected, as I shall presently
show, with the maternal family system. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
appears to be no real cause for this precaution. I
do not think it can be explained by the superstitious
dread of the sexes for each other, expressing itself
in this form of sexual taboo; as Mr. Crawley and
other writers suggest. Doubtless this is a factor,
and a very powerful one, in the continuance of the
custom, but it does not seem to me to be the true
explanation of its origin. Such secrecy and clandestine
meetings are, however, exactly what must
have happened if the group-daughters received their
lovers, as I would suggest, in defiance of the will
of the patriarch. May not the custom as it still
exists be a survival, retained and strengthened by
superstition, from a time when these fugitive visits
were necessary for safety?<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Atkinson&#8217;s view is different from mine. He
does not allow any power at all to the women. He
holds that after the death of the patriarch, his
daughters, still young, would be left without husbands.
To meet this difficulty suitors are brought
from other groups by the brothers, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the sons
settled in the group and who now rule. We are
asked to believe that they do this to relieve themselves
of the maintenance of their widowed sisters,
and to prevent their being captured and carried off
to other groups. According to Mr. Atkinson the
presence of these outside lovers would not be
dangerous to the family peace. They would come
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>from neighbouring groups, from which the young
men had already captured their wives. In this
way the strangers would be the brothers of their
women; and thus the brother-and-sister avoidance&mdash;the
primal law already established&mdash;would prevent
any fear of interference with the established marital
rights on the part of the new-comers. I strongly
differ from the suggestion that the brothers had to
feed and maintain their widowed sisters; such an
opinion is but another example of a failure to appreciate
the women&#8217;s side of the question. I allow
willingly that the sisters may have had the assistance
of their brothers; I incline, indeed, to the opinion
that they would be strong enough to compel their
help, though probably this was not necessary. The
group-sisters and the group-brothers may well have
united against the father, who was the enemy of
both. To me the common-sense view is that these
visits from outside suitors were first paid clandestinely
at night. In the light of human nature it is
at least probable that the tyrant father was deceived
by his daughters and his sons. If already he was
dead, what reason was there for any fear&mdash;why were
the visits secret? This seems to show that I am
right; that once more the initiative in the changes
that led to regulation must be traced back to women.
Afterwards, the custom thus established, would come
to be recognised, and the practice of the husband
visiting his wife by night would persist long after the
danger making such secrecy necessary had ceased.</p>

<p>It will be readily seen that the introduction of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
young husbands from outside, by whatever means
this was done, would be an immense gain in strength.
Again a new regulation in the sexual relationships
would follow, and the group-daughters would now
have husbands of their own generation, sacred to
them. Furthermore it was the first direct step
in friendly union between group and group; a step
that would open up ways to further progress. The
husband, living in his own group, and visiting his
wife in hers, would at once form a connecting link
between two hitherto separate family circles, which
friendly connection would not be broken, when,
later, the custom arose of the husband leaving his
group to take up his residence with his wife.</p>

<p>Such an arrangement must have been of immense
advantage to the women. Under the new order,
a wife married to one of these young strangers would
hold a position of considerable power, that hitherto
had been impossible. We have seen that the home
was made by the group-women, and must have
belonged to them; but so far, the continuance of a
daughter in the home had entailed the acceptance of
her father as a husband; the only way of escape
being by capture, which&mdash;whether forced or, as I
hold, aided by the girl&#8217;s desire&mdash;sent her out from
her own family as a stranger into a hostile group.
Now this was reversed, and the husband entered
as the alien into her home and family.</p>

<p>The following observation of Mr. Atkinson in this
connection must be quoted, as it is in strong agreement
with my own view<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;As a wife who had not been captured, who, in
fact, as an actual member of the group itself, was,
so to speak, the capturer, <i>her position in regard to
her dependent husband would be profoundly modified</i>,
in comparison with that of the ordinary captive
female, whereas such a captive, seized by the usual
process of hostile capture, had been a mere chattel
utterly without power; <i>she, as a free agent in her
own home, with her will backed by that of her brothers</i>&#8221;
[why not, I would ask, her sisters and her mother?]
&#8220;<i>could impose law on her subject spouse</i>.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p></div>

<p>In the foregoing sentences Mr. Atkinson affirms
the fateful significance to women of this new form
of marriage. I am in whole-hearted agreement with
this opinion. I glean here and there from the
wealth of Mr. Atkinson&#8217;s suggestions, statements
which indicate how nearly he came to seeing all
that I am trying to establish. Yet, I am compelled
to disagree with his main argument; for always
when he touches the woman&#8217;s side, he falls back at
once to consider the question in its relation to the
males as the only important members in the group.
I do not, for instance, accept his view that the captive
wives were &#8220;mere chattels.&#8221; They could not, under
the conditions, have been without some considerable
power, even if it arose only from the sexual dependence
of their owners upon them. Much more
significant, however, is Mr. Atkinson&#8217;s view regarding
the authority of the wife in these new peaceable
marriages. He sees one point only as arising from
such a position, and finds &#8220;a psychological factor
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>of enormous power, now for the first time able to
make itself felt, in the play of sexual jealousy on
the part of the wife.&#8221; She would now &#8220;impose
law on her subject spouse, and such law dictated
by jealousy would ordain a bar to intercourse
between him and her more youthful and hence more
attractive daughters.&#8221; Now, I do not deny that
such a factor may have acted, for the incentive to
jealousy arises always from individual as opposed
to collective possession. Still I do not think
jealousy can have been strong in this case, and,
even if it were not, any reversion on the part of an
alien father to the habits of the patriarch must
have been impossible; such conduct would not
have been tolerated by the other males in the group,
nor by the daughters, now able to get young
husbands for themselves. To limit the wife&#8217;s power
to this single issue can hardly be consistent with
the conditions of the case. Mr. Atkinson, in common
with many other anthropologists, seems disposed to
underrate the evidence regarding the far-reaching
importance of this form of marriage. Among
existing examples of the maternal family, the
mother-rights and influences of women are dependent
largely on the position of the husband as a stranger
in her family home. This matter will become clear
in the later part of my inquiry.</p>

<p>With the establishment of this new peaceful
marriage the way was cleared for future progress;
it is but a few further steps for the group to grow
into the clan and the tribe. The family-group has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
increased greatly in size and in social organisation,
from the time when it consisted of the patriarch,
and his community of women and young children.
The group-sons have brought in wives from other
groups and have founded families; the group-daughters
now have husbands who live with them.
Primitive regulations over the marital rights have
arisen, enabling peace to be maintained. Each
family to some extent would be complete in itself.
As the groups advanced in progress, totem names
would come to be used as family marks of distinction,
taken usually from some plant or animal. Peaceable
marriages between the sons and daughters of the
different groups would more and more become the
habit, and would gradually take the place of capture
marriages. The regulation of the sexual relationships,
by which certain women and certain men
became sacred to each other, would become more
strongly fixed by custom; and afterwards the law
would follow that a group of kindred, distinguished
by its totem mark, might not marry within the
hereditary name. The religious superstitions that
came to be connected with these totem names would
make binding the new order in the marriage law.
When this stage was reached exogamy would be
strictly practised; and in all cases under the complete
maternal system, the woman on marriage
would remain in her family home, where the husband
would come to live with her as a kind of privileged
guest.</p>

<p>There is one other matter that must be noted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
The totem name was inherited from the mother,
and not the father. This was the natural arrangement.
When the group was small, there may have
been a communal ownership of the group-children
by the mothers, under the authority of the father.
But this would not continue for long; when the
group increased in numbers, the mother and her
children would keep together as a little sub-family
in the larger circle. This would be especially the
case with captured wives, who would bring with
them the totem marks of their groups, and this
would be the name of the children. The naming of
the children after the mother would also be the
simplest way of distinguishing between the offspring
of different wives, a distinction that would often
be necessary, during the earlier conditions, among
the polygamous fathers.</p>

<p>It is, however, an entirely mistaken view that
the father&#8217;s relation to the child was ever unrecognised.
The taking of the name of the mother arose
as a matter of course, and was adopted simply as
being the most convenient custom. It is manifest
that mother-descent has no connection with a period
of promiscuity. Quite the reverse. All the conditions
of mother-right arose out of the earliest
movements towards order and regulation in the
relationships of the sexes, and were not the result
of licence. Nor was the naming of the child after
the mother so much a question of relationship as
of what may be called &#8220;social kinship.&#8221; The
causes which led to the maternal system are closely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
connected with the collective motive, which, if I
am right, was in its origin, at least, the result of the
union of the women against the selfish inclinations
of the patriarch. When property rights came to be
recognised, consisting at first of stores of food and
the household goods, it would be perfectly natural
that they should belong to the women, and descend
through them. The inheritance would be to those
most closely bound together, and who lived together
in the same home. Thus it appears that descent
through the mother was founded on social rights, by
which the organisation of the family, such as membership
in the group or clan, succession and inheritance
were dependent on the mothers. In this sense
it is clear that the term mother-power is fully
justified; it is nearer to the facts than the term
mother-kin.</p>

<p>Further than this I must not go; the first part of
my inquiry now has come to an end. It may seem
to the reader that the patriarchal theory, in a book
written to establish mother-right, has received more
attention than was called for. I have discussed it
so fully, not only because of the interest of the
subject in proving the errors in the earlier theories
of matriarchy, but because of the insight the conditions
of the primordial group give us into the
origin of the maternal family.</p>

<p>Many of the suggestions made are more or less
hypothetical, but not a few, I think, are necessary
deductions, based on what is most probable to have
happened. I am fully aware of numerous omissions,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and the inadequacy of this summary; but if the
suggestions brought forward shall prove in themselves
to have merit, it has seemed to me that a
fruitful field of investigation has been opened.
Much new ground had to be covered in this attempt
to picture the position of women at a period so
remote that the difficulties are very great. I hope
at least to have cleared away the old errors, which
connected mother-descent with uncertainty of
paternity and an early period of promiscuity.</p>

<p>Recognising sexual jealousy as the moving force
in brute man, I have accepted that the primeval
family was of the patriarchal type. I have traced
the probable development of the group-family,
expanding by successive steps into larger groups
living in peaceful association. In the earlier stage,
whilst the men lived as solitary despots, the women
enjoyed a communal life. It is thus probable that
the leading power in the upward movement of the
group developing into the clan and tribe arose among
the united mothers, and not with the father. The
women were forced into social conduct. On this
belief is based the theory of mother-power.</p>

<p>The most important result we have gained is the
proof that the maternal system was framed for order,
and has no connection with sexual disorder. It is
enough if I have suggested reasons to show that
this widespread custom, which is practised still
among many peoples, has nothing about it that is
exceptional, nothing fantastic, nothing improbable.
I hold it to be a perfectly natural arrangement&mdash;the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
practical outgrowth of the practical needs of
primitive peoples. The strongest and the one certain
claim for a belief in mother-right and mother-power
must rest on this foundation. It is left for
the second part of my book to prove how far I am
right in what I claim.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></h2>

<h3>THE MATRIARCHAL FAMILY AMONG THE
AMERICAN INDIANS</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is time now to turn to the actual subject of
this investigation, in order to see how far the theory
of mother-right has been helped by the lengthy
examination of the patriarchal group.</p>

<p>Since the publication of <i>Das Mutterrecht</i> much has
been written that has tended to raise doubts as to
the soundness of the matriarchal theory, at least in
the form held by its early supporters. A reaction
in the opposite direction has set in, before which the
former belief in mother-power has been transformed,
and now seems likely to disappear altogether. In
recent years, Westermarck, Starcke, Andrew Lang,
N.&nbsp;W. Thomas, and Crawley among others have
given utterance to this view. The prevalence of a
system tracing descent through the mother is accepted
by the majority of learned opinion, though
it would seem somewhat grudgingly. Mr. Crawley
is the only writer, as far as I know, who denies that
such a practice was ever common; the cases in
which it still exists, as these cannot be denied, he
regards as exceptions. He affirms: &#8220;There is no
evidence that the maternal system was ever general<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
or always preceded the paternal system.&#8221; And
again: &#8220;Though frequent, maternal descent cannot
have been either universally or generally a stage
through which man has passed.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Crawley considers this assumption may be
taken for granted; so that he does not trouble
himself about proofs. The subject of mother-right
is dismissed as unworthy of serious attention. Such
an attitude is surely instructive, and illustrates the
failure, to which I have already pointed, in considering
the woman&#8217;s side in these questions.
There would seem to be a tendency to doubt as
being possible any family arrangement favourable
to the authority of women. Even when descent
through the mother is accepted as a phase in social
development, it is denied that such descent confers
any special rights to women.</p>

<p>One reason of this prejudice must be sought in
the persistence of the puritan spirit: the objection
to mother-kin rests mainly on the objection to
loose sexual relationships. Thus it became necessary
to attempt a new explanation of the origin of
the custom, and hence my examination of the
primordial patriarchal group. It may be thought
that I should have done better to confine my inquiry
to existing primitive peoples. But, if I am right,
mother-power is rooted much further back than
history, and arose first in the dawn of the human
family. This had to be established.</p>

<p>It is clearly of vital importance to an inquiry
that claims to set up a new belief in a discredited
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>theory to protect it from those objections which
hitherto have prevented its acceptance. This I
have attempted to do. I have shown that the
customs connected with mother-right had no connection
at all with a state of promiscuity; that
they were the result of order in the sexual relationships,
and not of disorder. I have traced the
causes which appear to have given rise to such a
system, showing that the maternal order was not
the first phase of the family, but was a natural
forward movement&mdash;one which developed slowly
and quite simply from the conditions of the patriarchal
group. Moreover, I have maintained, and
tried to prove, that the initiative in progress was
taken by the women, they being inspired by their
collective interest to overcome the individual
interests of the male members of the group. If this
is not assented to, then indeed, my view of mother-power
can find no acceptance.</p>

<p>It is necessary, however, once more to guard
against any mistake. I do not wish to prove a
theory of gyn&aelig;cocracy, or rule of woman. The
title chosen for this chapter at once opens the way to
misinterpretation. It might appear as if I supported
Bachofen&#8217;s supposition that, under a system
of maternal descent women possessed supreme rule
in the family and in the clan: this is a dream only
of visionaries. I declare here that I consider the
theory of the so-called matriarchate at once false
and injurious: false, because it can lead to nothing;
and injurious, because, while it cannot be supported
by facts, it overthrows what can be proved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
by the evidence that is open to all investigators.
Nothing will be gained by exaggeration and by
claiming over much for women. The term &#8220;matriarchal&#8221;
takes too much for granted that women at
one period ruled. Such a view is far from the
truth. All I claim, then, is this: the system by
which the descent of the name and the inheritance
of property passes through the female side of the
family placed women in a favourable position, with
definite rights in the family and clan, rights which,
in some cases, resulted in their having great and
even extraordinary power. This, I think, may be
granted. <i>If descent through the father stands, as it
is held to do, for the predominance of man over woman&mdash;the
husband over the wife, then it is at least surely
possible that descent through the mother may in some
cases have stood for the predominance of the wife over
the husband.</i> The reader will judge how far the
examples of the maternal family I am able to bring
forward support this claim.</p>

<p>The evidence for mother-right has never yet been
fully brought into notice; but much of the evidence
is now available. Our knowledge of the customs of
primitive peoples has increased greatly of late
years, and these afford a wide field for inquiry.
And although the examples of the complete maternal
family existing to-day are few in number&mdash;probably
not more than twenty tribes,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> yet the important
fact is that they occur among widely separated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>peoples in all the great regions of the uncivilised
world. Moreover, side by side with these, are found
a much larger number of imperfect systems, which
give unmistakable evidence of an earlier maternal
stage. Such examples are specially instructive;
they belong to a transitional period, and show the
maternal family in its decline as it passes into a
new patriarchal stage; often, indeed, we see the one
system competing in conflict with the other.</p>

<p>In this connection I may note that Westermarck
does not accept an early period when descent was
traced exclusively through the mother; he gives a
long list of peoples among whom the system is not
practised. These passages occur in his well-known
<i>Criticism of the Hypothesis of Promiscuity</i>,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and his
whole argument is based on the assumption that
mother-right arose through the tie between the
father and the child being unrecognised. But
mother-descent has no connection at all with uncertainty
of paternity. I venture to think Dr.
Westermarck has not sufficiently considered this
aspect of the question, and, if I mistake not, it is
this confusion of mother-descent with promiscuity
which explains his attitude towards the maternal
system, and his failure to recognise its favourable
influence on the status of women. In his opinion
this system of tracing descent does not materially
affect the relative power of the two sexes.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> In such
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>a view I cannot help thinking he is mistaken; and
I am supported in this by the fact that he makes the
important qualification that the husband&#8217;s power is
impaired when he lives among his wife&#8217;s kinsfolk.
Now, it is this form of marriage, or the more primitive
custom when the husband only visits his wife,
that is practised among the peoples who have preserved
the complete maternal family. Under such
a domestic arrangement, which really reverses the
position of the wife and the husband, mother-right
is found; this maternal marriage is, indeed, the true
foundation of the woman&#8217;s power. Where the
marriage system has been changed from the maternal
to the paternal form, and the wife is taken from the
protection of her own kindred to live in the home of
her husband, even when descent is still traced
through the mother, the chief authority is almost
always in the hands of the father. Thus it need not
cause surprise to find mother-descent combined with
a fully established patriarchal rule. But among
such peoples practices may often be met with that
can be explained only as survivals from an earlier
maternal system. Moreover, in other cases, we
meet with tribes that have not yet advanced to the
maternal stage. A study of existing tribes, and
of the records of ancient civilisations, will yield any
number of examples.</p>

<p>Unmistakable traces of mother-right may, indeed,
be found by those, whose eyes are opened to see, in
all races. In peasant festivals and dances, and in
many religious beliefs and ceremonies, we may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
meet with such survivals. They may be traced in
our common language, especially in the words used
for sex and for kin relationships. We can also find
them shadowed in certain of our marriage rites, and
sex habits to-day. Another source of evidence is
furnished by the widespread early occurrence of
mother-goddesses, who must be connected with a
system which places the mother in the forefront of
religious thought. Further proof may be gathered
from folk stories and heroic legends, whose interest
offers rich rewards in suggestions of a time when
honour rested with the sex to whom the inheritance
belonged. Thus, the difficulty of establishing a
claim for mother-right and mother-power does
not rest in any paucity of proof&mdash;but rather in its
superabundance.</p>

<p>It would be superfluous for me to dwell on the
difficulties of such an inquiry. The subject is
immensely complicated and wide-reaching, so that
I must keep strictly to the path set before me. It
is my purpose to outline the domestic relations in
the maternal family clan, and to examine the sex-customs
and forms of marriage. I shall limit myself
to those matters which throw some light on the
position of women, and shall touch on the features
of social life only in so far as they illustrate this.
These questions will be discussed in the three succeeding
chapters. Some portion of the matter given
has appeared already in the section on the &#8220;Mother-Age
Civilisation&#8221; in <i>The Truth about Woman</i>,
which gives examples of the maternal family in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
America, Australia, India and other countries.
Such examples formed a necessary part of the
historical section of that work; they are even more
necessary to this inquiry. Many new examples will
be given, and the examination of the whole subject
will be more exhaustive. These chapters will be
followed by a discussion of certain difficulties, and
an examination of the transition period in which
the maternal family gave way to the second patriarchal
stage with the family founded on the authority
of the father. A short chapter will be devoted to the
work done by women in primitive tribes and its
importance in relation to their position. Then will
come as full an account as is possible of the traces
of the mother-age to be found in the records of ancient
and existing civilised races; while a brief chapter will
be added on certain myths and legends which help to
elucidate the theory of women&#8217;s early power. The
final chapter will treat of general conclusions, with an
attempt to suggest certain facts which seem to bear
on present-day problems. Throughout I shall
support my investigation (as far as can be done in a
work primarily designed for a text-book) by examples,
which, in each case, have been carefully
chosen from trustworthy evidence of those who are
personally acquainted with the habits of the peoples
of whom they write. I shall try to avoid falling
into the error of a one-sided view. Facts will be
more important than reflections, and as far as
possible, I shall let these speak for themselves.</p>

<p>Let us now concentrate our attention on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
complete maternal family, where the clan is grouped
around the mothers.</p>

<p>The examples in this chapter will be taken from
the aboriginal tribes of North and South America
among whom traces of the maternal system are
common, while in some cases mother-right is still in
force. At the period of European discovery the
American Indians were already well advanced in the
primitive arts, and were very far removed from
savagery. Their domestic and social habits showed
an organisation of a very remarkable character;
among certain tribes there was a communal maternal
family, interesting and complicated in its arrangements.
Such customs had prevailed from an
antiquity so remote that their origin seems to have
been lost in the obscurity of the ages. It is possible,
however, to see how this communism in living may
have arisen and developed out of the conditions we
have studied in the far distant patriarchal groups.
For this reason they afford a very special interest to
our inquiry.</p>

<p>Morgan, who was commissioned by the American
Government to report on the customs of the aboriginal
inhabitants, gives a description of the system as
it existed among the Iroquois&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Each household was made up on the principle
of kin. The married women, usually sisters, own
or collateral, were of the same <i>gens</i> or clan, the
symbol or <i>totem</i> of which was often painted upon the
house, while their husbands and the wives of their
sons belonged to several other <i>gentes</i>. The children<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
were of the <i>gens</i> of their mother. As a rule the sons
brought home their wives, and in some cases the
husbands of the daughters were admitted to the
maternal household. Thus each household was
composed of persons of different <i>gentes</i>, but the
predominating number in each household would be
of the same <i>gens</i>, namely, that of the mother.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p></div>

<p>We see here, at once, the persistence and development
of the conditions and later customs of the
patriarchal family-group, now evolved into the clan.
In the far-distant days the jealous spirit was still
strong; now it has been curbed and regulated, and
the female yoke binds the clan together. We have
the mothers as the centre of the communal home;
the sons bringing their wives to live in the circle,
while the daughters&#8217; husbands are received as
permanent guests. Under such a system the
mothers are related to each other, and belong to the
same clan, and their children after them; the fathers
are not bound together by the same ties and are
of different clans. The limits within which marriage
can take place are fixed, and we can trace the action
of the ancient primal law in the bar that prohibits
the husband from being of the same clan as his wife.
Though the husband takes up his abode in the wife&#8217;s
family, dwelling there <i>during her life and his good
behaviour</i>,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> he still belongs to his own family. The
children of the marriage are of the kindred of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>mother, and never of his kindred: they are lost to
his family. Thus there can be no extension of the
clan through the males, it is the wife&#8217;s clan that is
extended by marriage.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>The important point to note is that the conditions
of the clan are still favourable to the social conduct of
the women, who are attached much more closely to the
home and to each other than can be the case with the
men. The wife never leaves the home, because she
is considered the mistress, or, at least, the heiress.
In the house all the duties and the honour as the
head of the household fall upon her. This position
may be illustrated by the wife&#8217;s obligation to her
husband and his family, which are curiously in
contrast with what is usually expected from a woman.
Thus a wife is not only bound to give food to her
husband, to cook his provisions when he sets out on
expeditions, but she has likewise to assist members
of his family when they cultivate their fields, and
to provide wood for an allotted period for the use of
his family. In this work she is assisted by women
of her clan. The women are also required in case of
need to look after their parents.</p>

<p>There are many interesting customs in the
domestic life of the Iroquois. I can notice a few
only. The system of living, at the time Morgan
visited the tribes, consisted of a plan at once novel
and distinctive. Each <i>gens</i> or clan lived in a long
tenement house, large enough to accommodate the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>separate families. These houses were erected on
frames of poles, covered with bark, and were from
fifty to a hundred feet in length. A passage way
led down the centre, and rooms were portioned off
on either side: the doors were at each end of the
passage. An apartment was allotted to each family.
There were several fireplaces, usually one for every
four families, which were placed in the central
passage: there were no chimneys. The Iroquois
lived in these long houses, <i>Ho-de-no-sau-nee</i>, up to
<small>A.D.</small> 1700, and in occasional instances for a hundred
years later. They were not peculiar to the Iroquois,
but were used by many tribes. Unfortunately this
wise plan of living has now almost entirely passed
away.</p>

<p>I wish that I had space to give a fuller account of
these families.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Each household practised communism
in living, and made a common stock of the
provisions acquired by fishing and hunting, and by
the cultivation of maize and plants. The curse of
individual accumulation would seem not to have
existed. Ownership of land and all property was
held in common. Each household was directed by
the matron who supervised its domestic economy.
After the daily meal was cooked at the several fires,
the matron was summoned, and it was her duty to
apportion the food from the kettle to the different
families according to their respective needs. What
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>food remained was placed in the charge of another
woman until it was required by the matron. In
this connection Mr. Morgan says: &#8220;This plan of
life shows that their domestic economy was not
without method, and it displays the care and
management of women, low down in barbarism, for
husbanding their resources and for improving their
conditions.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this statement, made by one who was intimately
acquainted with the customs of this people there is
surely confirmation of what I have claimed for
women? The further we go in our inquiry the more
we are driven to the conclusion that the favourable
conditions uniting the women with one another
exerted a powerful influence on their character. I
think this is a view of the maternal family system
that has never received its proper meed of attention.</p>

<p>It must be noted that the women did not eat with
the men; but the fact that the apportioning of the
food was in the women&#8217;s hands is sufficient proof that
this separation of women and men, common among
most primitive peoples, has no connection with the
superiority of one sex over the other. It is interesting
to find that only one prepared meal was served
in each day. But the pots were always kept boiling
over the fires, and any one who was hungry, either
from the household or from any other part of the
village, had a right to order it to be taken off and to
eat as he or she pleased.</p>

<p>We may notice the influence of their communistic
living in all the Indian customs. At all times the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
law of hospitality was strictly observed. Food was
dispensed in every case to those who needed it; no
excuse was ever made to avoid giving. If through
misfortune one household fell into want, the needs
were freely supplied from the stock laid by for future
use in another household. Hunger and destitution
could not exist in any part of an Indian village or
encampment while plenty prevailed elsewhere.
Such generosity at a time when food was often
difficult to obtain, and its supply was the first concern
of life, is a remarkable fact. Nor does this
generosity seem, as might be thought, to have led to
idleness and improvidence. He who begged, when
he could work, was stigmatised with the disgraceful
name of &#8220;poltroon&#8221; or &#8220;beggar&#8221;; but the miser
who refused to assist his neighbour was branded as
&#8220;a bad character.&#8221; Mr. Morgan, commenting on
this phase of the Indian life says: &#8220;I much doubt
if the civilised world would have in their institutions
any system which can properly be called more
humane and charitable.&#8221;</p>

<p>These reflections induce one to ask: What were
the causes of this humane system of living among
a people considered as uncivilised? Now, I do not
wish to claim overmuch for women. We have seen,
however, that the control and distribution of the
supply of food was placed in the hands of the
matrons, thus their association with the giving of
food must be accepted. Is not this fact sufficient
to indicate the reason that made possible this communism?
To me it is plain that these remarkable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
institutions were connected with the maternal
family, in which the collective interests were more
considered than is possible in a patriarchal society,
based upon individual inclination and proprietary
interests.</p>

<p>A brief notice must now be given to the system
of government. An Indian tribe was composed of
several <i>gentes</i> or clans, united in what is known as a
<i>phratry</i> or brotherhood. The tribe was an assemblage
of the <i>gentes</i>. The <i>phratry</i> among the Iroquois was
organised partly for social and partly for religious
objects. Each <i>gens</i> was ruled by chiefs of two
grades, distinguished by Morgan as the <i>sachem</i> and
common chiefs. The <i>sachem</i> was the official head of
the <i>gens</i>, and was elected by its adult members, male
and female. The <i>sachems</i> and chiefs claimed no
superiority and were never more than the exponents
of the popular will of the people. Unanimity among
the <i>sachems</i> was required on all public questions.
This was the fundamental law of the brotherhood;
if all efforts failed to gain agreement the matter
in question was dropped. Under such a system
individual rule or the power of one <i>gens</i> over the
other became impossible. All the members of the
different <i>gentes</i> were personally free; equal in privileges,
and in position, and in rights. &#8220;Liberty,
equality, and fraternity,&#8221; though never formulated,
were the cardinal principles of the <i>gens</i>.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Mr. Morgan
holds the opinion that &#8220;this serves to explain that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>sense of independence and personal dignity universally
attributed to the Indian character.&#8221;</p>

<p>Regarding the part taken by the women in the
government, we have very remarkable testimony.
Schoolcraft,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> in his elaborate study of the customs
of the Indian tribes, states that the women had &#8220;a
conservative power in the political deliberations.
The matrons had their representatives in the public
councils, and they exercised a negative, or what we
call a veto, power, in the important question of the
declaration of war.&#8221; They had also the right to
interpose in bringing about a peace. Heriot also
affirms: &#8220;In the women is vested the foundation
of all real authority. They give efficiency to the
councils and are the arbiters of war and peace....
It is also to their disposal that the captured slaves
are committed.&#8221; And again: &#8220;Although by
custom the leaders are chosen from among the men,
and the affairs which concern the tribe are settled
by a council of ancients, it would yet seem that they
only represented the women, and assisted in the
discussion of subjects which principally related to
that sex.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>These remarkable social and domestic conditions
were common to the American Indians under the
maternal system. The direct influence of women,
as directors through the men, is a circumstance of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>much interest. Among the Senecas, an Iroquoian
tribe with the complete maternal family, the
authority was very certainly in the hands of the
women. Morgan quotes an account of their family
system, given by the Rev. Ashur Wright for many
years a resident among the Senecas, and familiar
with their language and customs.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;As to their family system, it is probable that
one clan predominated (in the houses), the women
taking in husbands, however, from other clans,
and sometimes for novelty, some of their sons
bringing in their young wives, until they felt brave
enough to leave their mothers. Usually the female
portion ruled the house, and were doubtless clannish
enough about it. The stores were in common, but
woe to the luckless husband or lover who was too
shiftless to do his share of the providing. No matter
how many children or whatever goods he might
have in the house, he might at any time be ordered
to pack up his blanket and budge, and after such
orders it would not be healthful for him to attempt
to disobey; the house would be too hot for him, and
unless saved by the intercession of some aunt or
grandmother, he must retreat to his own clan, or,
as was often done, go and start a new matrimonial
alliance in some other. The women were the great
power among the clans as everywhere else. They
did not hesitate, when occasion required, to &#8216;knock
off the horns,&#8217; as it was technically called, from the
head of a chief and send him back to the ranks of the
warrior. The original nomination of the chief also
always rested with them.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Mr. Morgan affirms his acceptance of the Indian
women&#8217;s authority, and says, after quoting this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
passage: &#8220;The mother-right and gyn&aelig;cocracy
among the Iroquois here plainly indicated is not
over-drawn. The mothers and their children, as
we have seen, were of the same <i>gens</i>, and to them the
household belonged. The position of the mother
was eminently favourable to her influence in the
household, and tended to strengthen the maternal
bond.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>It is important to note that among the Iroquois
polygamy is not permitted, nor does it appear ever
to be practised. Many instances are reported in the
Seneca tribe of a woman having more than one
husband, but an Iroquoian man is never allowed
more than one wife.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> This is the more remarkable
when we consider the fact that the mothers nurse
their children for a very long period, during which
time they do not cohabit with their husbands.
Such entire absence of polygamy is to be explained,
in part, by the maternal marriage, a system which
in its origin was closely connected with sexual
regulation; nor would plurality of wives be possible
in a society in which all the members of both sexes
enjoyed equal privileges, and were in a position of
absolute equality. Marriages usually take place at
an early age. Under the maternal form, the
husband living with the wife worked for her family,
and commonly gained his footing only through his
service. As suitor he was required to make presents
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>to the bride&#8217;s family. During the first year of
marriage all the produce of his hunting expeditions
belonged to the wife, and afterwards he shared his
goods equally with her. The marriages were negotiated
by the mothers: sometimes the father was consulted,
but this was little more than a compliment, as
his approbation or opposition was usually disregarded.
Often it was customary for the bridegroom to seek
private interviews at night with his betrothed;
clearly a survival from a time when such secrecy in
love was necessary. In some instances it was
enough if the suitor went and sat by the girl&#8217;s side
in her apartment; if she permitted this, and remained
where she was, it was taken for consent, and
the act would suffice for marriage. Girls were
allowed the right of choice in the selection of their
partners. There is abundant testimony as to the
happiness of the marriage state. Divorce was,
however, allowed by mutual consent, and was
carried out without dispute, quarrel or contradiction.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
If a husband and a wife could not agree,
they parted amicably, or two unhappy pairs would
exchange husbands and wives. An early French
missionary remonstrated with a couple on such a
transaction, and was told: &#8220;My wife and I could
not agree; my neighbour was in the same case, so
we exchanged wives and all four were content.
What can be more reasonable than to render one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>another mutually happy, when it costs so little,
and does nobody any harm.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> It would seem that
these maternal peoples have solved many difficulties
of domestic and social life better than we ourselves
have done.</p>

<p>The Wyandots, another Iroquoian tribe, maintained
the maternal household, though they seem to
have reached a later stage of development than the
Senecas. They camped in the form of a horse-shoe,
every clan together in regular order. Marriage
between members of the same clan was forbidden;
the children belonged to the clan of the mother.
The husbands retained all their rights and privileges
in their own <i>gentes</i>, though they lived in the
<i>gentes</i> of their wives. After marriage the pair
resided, for a time, at least, with the wife&#8217;s mother,
but afterwards they set up housekeeping for
themselves.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>We may note in this change of residence the
creeping in of changes which inevitably led in
time to the decay of the maternal family and
the reassertion of the patriarchal authority of
the father. This is illustrated further by the
Musquakies, also belonging to the Algonquian
stock. Though still organised in clans, descent
is no longer reckoned through the mother; the
bridegroom, however, serves his wife&#8217;s family, and
he lives in her home. This does not make him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>of her clan, but she belongs to his, till his death or
divorce separates her from him. As for the children,
the minors at the termination of the marriage
belong to the mother&#8217;s clan, but those who had
had the puberty feast are counted to the father&#8217;s
clan.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>The male authority was felt chiefly in periods of
war. This may be illustrated by the Wyandots,
who have an elaborate system of government. In
each <i>gens</i> there is a small council composed of four
women, called <i>yu-wa&iacute;-yu-w&aacute;-na</i>; chosen by the
heads of the household. These women select a
chief of the <i>gens</i> from its male members, that is,
from their brothers and sons. He is the head of the
<i>gentile</i> council. The council of the tribe is composed
of the aggregated <i>gentile</i> councils; and is thus
made up of four-fifths of women and one-fifth of
men. The <i>sachem</i> of the tribes, or tribal-chief, is
chosen by the chiefs of the <i>gentes</i>. All the civil
government of the <i>gens</i> and of the tribe is carried on
by these councils; and as the women so largely
outnumbered the men, who are also&mdash;with the one
exception of the tribal-chief&mdash;chosen by them, it is
evident that the social government of the <i>gens</i> and
tribe is largely controlled by them. On military
affairs, however, the men have the direct authority,
though, as has been stated, the women have a veto
power and are &#8220;allowed to exercise a decision in
favour of peace.&#8221; There is a military council of all
the able-bodied men of the tribe, with a military
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>chief chosen by the council.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> This seems a very
wise adjustment of civic duties; the constructive
social work and the maintaining of peace directed
by the women; the destructive work of war in the
hands of men.</p>

<p>Powell gives an interesting account of their communal
life. Each clan owns its own lands which it
cultivates; but within these lands each household
has its own patch. It is the women councillors who
partition the clan lands among the households.
The partition takes place every two years. But
while each household has its own patch of ground,
the cultivation is communal; that is, all the able-bodied
women of the clan take a share in cultivating
every patch. Each clan has a right to the service
of all its women in the cultivation of the soil. It
would be difficult to find a more striking example
than this of communism in labour. I claim it as
proof of what I have stated in an earlier chapter of
the conditions driving women into combination and
social conduct.</p>

<p>If we turn now to the South American continent
we shall find many interesting survivals of the complete
maternal family, in particular among the
Pueblo peoples of New Mexico and Arizona, so
called from the Spanish word <i>pueblo</i>, a town. The
customs of the people have been carefully studied
and recorded by Bancroft, Schoolcraft, Morgan,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>Tylor, McGee, the Spanish historian, Herrera, and
other travellers. When first visited by European
anthropologists the country was divided into
provinces, and in many provinces the people lived
in communities or little republics. The communal
life was here more developed even than among the
Northern Indians. The people lived together in
joint tenement houses, much larger, and of more
advanced architecture, than the long houses of the
Iroquois. These houses are constructed of adobe,
brick and stone, imbedded in mortar; one house
will contain as many as 50, 100, 200, and in some
cases, 500 apartments. Speaking of these houses,
Bancroft states: &#8220;The houses are common property,
and both women and men assist in building
them; the men erect the wooden frames, and the
women make the mortar and build the walls. In
place of lime for mortar they mix ashes with earth
and charcoal. They make <i>adobes</i>, or sun-dried
bricks, by mixing ashes and earth with water.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
Cushing, who visited and lived with the Zu&ntilde;i Indians,
records that among them the houses are entirely
built by the women, the men supplying the material.
These houses are erected in terrace form; within they
are provided with windows, fireplaces and chimneys,
and the entrance to the different apartments is
gained by rude pole ladders. The pueblo, or
village, consists of one or two, or sometimes a
greater number of these houses, each containing a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>hundred or more families, according to the number
of apartments.</p>

<p>Among the Creek Indians of Georgia, Morgan
recounts a somewhat different mode of communal
dwelling as formerly being practised. In 1790 they
were living in small houses, placed in clusters of
from four to eight together; and each cluster
forming a <i>gens</i> or clan, who ate and lived in common.
The food was prepared in one hut, and each family
sent for its portion. The smallest of these &#8220;garden
cities&#8221; contained 10 to 40 groups of houses, the
largest from 50 to 200.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> These communistic dwelling-houses
are so interesting and so important that I
would add a few words. Here, we have among these
maternal peoples a system of living which appears
to be identical with the improved conditions of
associated dwelling now beginning to be tried. How
often we consider new things that really are very
old! In the light of these examples, our co-operative
dwelling-houses and garden cities can no
longer be regarded as experiments. They were in
use in the mother-age, when many of our new (!)
ideas seem to have been common. Can this be
because of the extended power held by women, who
are more practical and careful of detail than men
are? I believe that it is possible. This would
explain, too, the revival of the same ideas to-day,
when women are taking up their part again in social
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>life. To those who are questioning the waste and
discomfort of our solitary homes I would recommend
a careful study of this primitive communism. I
would point out the connection of the social ideal
with the maternal family, while the home that is
solitary and unsocial must be regarded as having
arisen from the patriarchal customs. I have had
occasion again and again to note that collective
interests are more considered by women; and individual
interests by men. This, at least, is how I see
it; and a study of the Indian maternal families
seems to give confirmation to such a conclusion.</p>

<p>But to return to the Pueblo peoples. The tribes
are divided into exogamous totem clans. Kinship
is reckoned through the women, and in several
tribes we find the complete maternal family.
Among such peoples the husband goes to live with the
wife and becomes an inmate of her family. If the
house is not large enough, additional rooms are built
on to the communal home and connected with
those already occupied. Hence a family with many
daughters increases, while one consisting of sons
dies out.</p>

<p>The marriage customs and relationships between
the young men and the girls are instructive; they
vary in the different tribes, but have some points
in common. The Pueblos are monogamists, and
polygamy is not allowed amongst them. Bancroft
records a very curious custom. The morals of the
young people are carefully guarded by a kind of
secret police, whose duty it is to report all irregularities;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
and in the event of such taking place the
young man and the girl are compelled to marry.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
Now, whatever opinion may be held of such interference
with the love-making of the young people,
it affords strong proof of the error which has hitherto
connected the maternal system with unregulated
sexual relationships. This is a fact I am again and
again compelled to point out, risking the fear of
wearying the reader.</p>

<p>Among some tribes freedom is permitted to the
women before marriage. Heriot states that the
natives who allow this justify the custom, and say
&#8220;that a young woman is mistress of her own person,
and a free agent.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> The tie of marriage is, however,
observed more strictly than among many civilised
monogamous races. And this is so, although divorce
is always easy and by mutual consent; a couple
being able to separate at once if they are dissatisfied
with each other. Here are facts that may well
cause us to think. As for the courtship, the usual
custom is reversed; when a girl is disposed to marry
she does not wait for a young man to propose to
her, but selects one to her liking, and then consults
her family as to his suitability as a husband. The
suitor has to serve the bride&#8217;s family before he can
be accepted, and in some cases the conditions are
binding and exceedingly curious.</p>

<p>How simple and really beautiful are the conditions
of life among these people may be seen from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>idyllic record of the Zu&ntilde;i Indians given by Mr.
Cushing.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> He describes how the Zu&ntilde;i girl, when
taking a fancy to a young man, conveys a present of
thin <i>hewe</i>-bread to him as a token, and becomes his
affianced, or as they say &#8220;his-to-be.&#8221; He then
sews clothes and moccasins for her, makes her a
necklace of gay beads, and combs her hair out on the
terrace in the sun. After his term of service is over,
and all is settled, he takes up his residence with
her; then the married life begins. &#8220;With the
woman rests the security of the marriage tie, and,
it must be said, in her high honour, that she rarely
abuses the privilege; that is, never sends her
husband &#8216;to the home of his fathers&#8217; unless he
richly deserves it.&#8221; Divorce is by mutual consent,
and a husband and wife would &#8220;rather separate than
live together unharmoniously.&#8221; This testimony is
confirmed by Mrs. Stevenson, who visited the Zu&ntilde;is,
and writes with enthusiasm of the people. &#8220;Their
domestic life might well serve as an example for the
civilised world. They do not have large families.
The husband and wife are deeply attached to one
another and to their children.&#8221; &#8220;The keynote of
this harmony is the supremacy of the wife in the
home. The house with all that is in it is hers,
descending to her through her mother from a long
line of ancestresses; and the husband is merely her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>permanent guest. The children&mdash;at least the female
children&mdash;have their share in the common home;
the father has none.&#8221; &#8220;Outside the house the
husband has some property in the fields, although in
earlier times he had no possessory rights and the
land was held in common. Modern influences have
reached the Zu&ntilde;i, and mother-right seems to have
begun its inevitable decay.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>The Hopis, another Pueblo tribe, are more conservative,
and with them the women own all the
property except the horses and donkeys, which
belong to the men. Among the Pueblos the women
commonly have control over the granary, and they
are very provident about the future. Ordinarily
they try to have one year&#8217;s provisions on hand. It
is only when two years of scarcity succeed each
other that the community suffers hunger. Like
the Zu&ntilde;is, the Hopis are monogamists. Sexual
freedom is, however, permitted to a girl before
marriage. This in no way detracts from her good
repute; even if she has given birth to a child &#8220;she
will be sure to marry later on, unless she happens
to be shockingly ugly.&#8221; Nor does the child suffer,
for among these maternal peoples, the bastard takes
an equal place with the child born in wedlock. The
bride lives for the first few weeks with her husband&#8217;s
family, during which time the marriage takes place,
the ceremony being performed by the bridegroom&#8217;s
mother, whose family also provides the bride with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>her wedding outfit. The couple then return to the
home of the wife&#8217;s parents, where they remain,
either permanently, or for some years, until they can
obtain a separate dwelling. The husband is always
a stranger, and is so treated by his wife&#8217;s kin. The
dwelling of his mother remains his true home, in
sickness he returns to her to be nursed, and stays
with her until he is well again. Often his position
in his wife&#8217;s home is so irksome that he severs his
connection with her and her family, and returns to
his old home. On the other hand, it is not uncommon
for the wife, should her husband be absent,
to place his goods outside the door: an intimation
which he well understands, and does not intrude
upon her again.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Again, among the Pueblo peoples, we may consider
the Sai. Like the other tribes they are
divided into exogamous totem clans; descent is
traced only through the mother. The tribe through
various reasons has been greatly reduced in numbers,
and whole clans have died out, and under these
circumstances exogamy has ceased to be strictly
enforced. This has led to other changes. The Sai
are still normally monogamous. When a young
man wishes to marry a girl he speaks first to her
parents; if they are willing he addresses himself
to her. On the day of the marriage he goes alone
to her home, carrying his presents wrapped in a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>blanket, his mother and father having preceded him
thither. When the young people are seated together
the parents address them in turn, enjoining
unity and forbearance. This constitutes the ceremony.
Tribal custom requires the bridegroom to
reside with the wife&#8217;s family.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>All the Pueblo peoples are more advanced than
the greater number of the neighbouring tribes; their
matrimonial customs are more refined, their domestic
life much happier, and they have an appreciation
of love, a rare thing in primitive peoples.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Among
other tribes purchase of a wife is common, always
a sure sign of the enslavement of women. Thus in
Columbia what is most prized in a woman is her
aptitude for labour, and the price paid for her
(usually in horses) depends on her capacity as a
beast of burden. Sometimes, as in California, a
suitor obtains a wife on credit, but then the man is
called &#8220;half married;&#8221; and until her price is paid
he has to labour as a slave for her parents. Here,
as elsewhere, morality is simply a custom of habit;
Bancroft says that purchase of a wife has become
accepted as honourable, so that among the Californian
Redskins &#8220;the children of a wife who has cost
nothing to her husband are looked down upon.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
Such customs are in sharp contrast to the liberty
granted to the woman among the Pueblos. As an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>example of women&#8217;s power carried to the limit of
tyranny, we may note the Nicaraguans, of whom
Bancroft states that &#8220;the husbands are said to
have been so much under the control of their wives
that they were obliged to do the housework, while
the women attended to the trading.&#8221; Under these
circumstances it is perhaps not surprising to find
the women described as &#8220;great shrews, who would
on the slightest provocation drive their offending
husbands out of the house.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> This is a curious case of
the despotic rule of women. Westermarck accounts
for their position by the strict monogamy that is
enforced, but I do not think this can be the true
explanation.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>Among the Guanas the women make their own
stipulations with their lovers before marriage,
arranging what they are to do in the household.
They are also said to decide the conditions of the
marriage, whether it is to be monogamous, or if
polygamy or polyandry is to be allowed.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> The
Zapotecs and other tribes inhabiting the Isthmus of
Tehuantepec, are remarkable for &#8220;the gentleness,
affection, and frugality that characterises the
marital relations. Polygamy is not permitted, which
is very remarkable as the women greatly outnumber
the men.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>Lastly, I wish to bring forward a very striking
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>example of the complete maternal family among
the Seri Indians, on the south-west coast of North
America, now reduced to a single tribe. Their
curious and interesting marriage customs have
been described by McGee, who visited the people to
report on their customs for the American Government.
The Seri are probably the most primitive
tribe in the American continent. At the time
of Mr. McGee&#8217;s visit they preserved the maternal
system in its early form, and are therefore an
instructive example by which to estimate the
position of the women.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The tribe is divided into exogamous totem
clans. Marriage is arranged exclusively by the
women. The elder woman of the suitor&#8217;s family
carries the proposal to the girl&#8217;s clan mother. If
this is entertained, the question of marriage is
discussed at length by the matrons of the two clans.
The girl herself is consulted; a <i>jacal</i> is erected for
her, and after many deliberations, the bridegroom is
provisionally received into the wife&#8217;s clan for a year
under conditions of the most exacting character.
He is expected to prove his worthiness of a permanent
relationship by demonstrating his ability as a
provider, and by showing himself an implacable
foe to aliens. He is compelled to support all the
female relatives of his bride&#8217;s family by the products
of his skill and industry in hunting and fishing for
one year. There is also another provision of a very
curious nature. The lover is permitted to share the
<i>jacal</i>, or sleeping-robe, provided for the prospective
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>matron by her kinswomen, not as a privileged
spouse, but merely as a protective companion; and
throughout this probationary time he is compelled
to maintain continence&mdash;he must display the most
indubitable proof of his moral force.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>This test of the Seri lover must not mistakenly be
thought to be connected, as might appear, with the
modern idea of continence. As is pointed out by
McGee, it arose out of the primitive sexual taboos,
and is imposed on the young man as a test of his
strength to abstain from any sexual relationships
outside the proscribed limits. Such a moral test
may once have been common, but seems to have
been lost except among the Seri; though a curious
vestige appears in the anti-nuptial treatment of the
bridegroom, in the Salish tribe. The material test
is common among many peoples, and must not be
confused with the later custom of payment for the
wife by presents given to her family. Still this Seri
marriage is one of the most curious I know among
any primitive peoples. And the continence demanded
from the bridegroom appears more extraordinary
if we compare it with the freedom granted
to the bride. &#8220;During this period the always
dignified position occupied by the daughters of the
house culminates.&#8221; Among other privileges she is
allowed to receive the &#8220;most intimate attentions
from the clan-fellows of the group.&#8221; &#8220;She is the
receiver of the supplies furnished by her lover,
measuring his competence as would-be husband.
Through his energy she is enabled to dispense<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
largess with a lavish hand, and thus to dignify her
clan and honour her spouse in the most effective
way known to primitive life; and at the same time
she enjoys the immeasurable moral stimulus of
realising she is the arbiter of the fate of a man who
becomes a warrior or an outcast at her bidding, and
through him of the future of two clans&mdash;she is
raised to a responsibility in both personal and
tribal affairs which, albeit temporary, is hardly
lower than that of the warrior chief.&#8221; At the close
of the year, if all goes well, the probation ends in a
feast provided by the lover, who now becomes the
husband, and finally enters his wife&#8217;s <i>jacal</i> as &#8220;consort-guest.&#8221;
His position is wholly subordinate,
and without any authority whatever, either over
his children or over the property. In his mother&#8217;s
hut he has rights, which seem to continue after his
marriage, but in his wife&#8217;s hut he has none.</p>

<p>I have now collected together, with as much
exactitude as I could, what is known of the maternal
family in the American continents. There are many
tribes in which descent is reckoned through the
father, and it would be bold to assert that these
have all passed through the maternal stage. An
examination of their customs shows, in some cases,
survivals, which point to such conclusion; among
other tribes it seems probable that the maternal clan
has not developed. As illustrations of mother-power,
I claim the examples given speak for
themselves. It may, of course, be urged that these
complete maternal families are exceptions, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
thus to dismiss them as unimportant. But this is
surely an unscientific way of settling the question.
One has to accept these cases, or to prove that
they are untrue. Moreover, I have by no means
exhausted the evidence; and to these complete
maternal families might be added examples from
other tribes which would furnish similar proofs,
but there is such consistency of custom among
them all that further accounts may be dispensed
with.</p>

<p>There is one other matter for which I would
claim attention before closing this chapter on the
American Indians, and that is the remarkable
similarity to be noticed in many tribes between the
faces of the men and the women. To me this is a
point of deep interest, though I do not claim to
understand it. My attention was first drawn to
notice this likeness between the two sexes when I
came to know some Iroquois natives who live in
England. I was at once struck with the appearance
of the men: though strong and powerfully built,
they were strikingly like women. Since then I have
examined many portraits of the North Indian
tribes; I have found that the great majority of men
approach much more nearly to the feminine than
the male type. I might, however, hesitate to bring
the matter forward, were it founded only on my own
observation. But in my reading I have found an
important reference to the question in a recent work,
&#8220;The Indians of North America in Recent Times,&#8221; by
Mr. Cyrus Thomas, Ph.D., Arch&aelig;ologist, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
<i>Bureau of American Ethnology</i>. He writes as
follows (p. 41)&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Another curious fact, which has not hitherto
received special notice, though apparently of considerable
interest, is the prevailing feminine physiognomy
of the males, at least of those of the northern
section. If any one will take the trouble to study
carefully a hundred or more good photographs of
males of pure blood he will find that two thirds, if
not a greater proportion, show feminine faces. The
full significance of this fact is not apparent, but it
seems to bear to some extent upon the question of
the evolution of the race.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>What this fact suggests is a problem to which it
is very difficult even to guess at an answer. Does
this lack of differentiation in the physiognomy of the
Indians point to something much deeper? Are
the men really like the women? Such a conception
opens up considerations of very great significance.
So far as I understand the matter, it appears that,
as well as the deep inherent differences between the
two sexes, there are other differences due to divergence
in function. It seems probable that changes in
environment or in function (as when one sex, for
some reason or other, performs the duties usually
undertaken by the other sex), may alter or modify
the differences which tend to thrust the sexes apart.
I feel very sure that there can be changes in the
secondary sexual characters of the male and female.
This is sufficiently proved by many examples. Can
we, then, accept the theory that an environment,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
which favours women&#8217;s forceful function, may modify
the infinitely complicated characters of sex, which, as
yet, we so imperfectly understand? I do not know
with any certainty. Yet I can see no other interpretation;
and, if I mistake not, it may be possible
in this way to cast a light on one of the most
difficult problems with which we are faced to-day.</p>

<h3>THE MATERNAL FAMILY AMONG THE KHASIS</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are, perhaps, no people among whom the
family in the full maternal form can be studied with
more advantage than the Khasi Hill tribes, in the
north-east of India. This race has a special interest
as a people who, in modern times, have preserved
their independence and their ancestral customs
through many centuries. We find mother-descent
strictly practised, combined with great and even
extraordinary rights on the part of the women.
The isolation of the Khasis may account for this
conservatism, but, as will appear later, there are
other causes to explain the freedom and power of
the Khasi women. We are fortunate in having a
fuller knowledge of the Khasi tribes, than is common
of many primitive peoples. Their institutions and
interesting domestic customs have been carefully
noted by ethnologists and travellers, and in all
accounts there is united testimony to the high
status of the women. I will quote a statement of
Sir Charles Lyell,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> which affirms this fact very
strongly&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Their social organisation presents one of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>most perfect examples still surviving of matriarchal
institutions carried out with a logic and a thoroughness
which, to those accustomed to regard the status
and authority of the father as the foundation of
society, are exceedingly remarkable. Not only is
the mother the head and source and only bond of
union of the family, in the most primitive part of
the hills, the Synteng country, she is the only owner
of real property, and through her alone is inheritance
transmitted. The father has no kinship with his
children, who belong to their mother&#8217;s clan; what
he earns goes to his own matriarchal stock, and at
his death his bones are deposited in the cromlech
of his mother&#8217;s kin.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Such testimony cannot be put aside. I wish it
were possible for me to give a detailed account of
this people, there is so much that is of interest to
us in their mother-right customs. All that I can
do is to note briefly a few of these, which to me
seem specially important.</p>

<p>And first, in order to understand better their
customs, let us consider a few facts of the people
themselves. The Khasis are a vigorous and sturdy
race. The men are short, but exceedingly muscular;
the women are comely, especially when young; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>the children are remarkably pretty. In both the
sexes strongly developed calves are considered a
mark of beauty. It is interesting to note that the
men usually wear their hair long, and when it is
cut short, a single lock is preserved at the back,
which is called <i>u niuhtrong</i>, &#8220;the grandmother&#8217;s
lock.&#8221; In some districts the men pull out the hairs
of the moustaches, with the exception of a few hairs
on either side of the upper lip. In character these
people are independent, simple, truthful and straightforward;
cheerful in disposition, and light-hearted
by nature. They thoroughly appreciate a joke,
especially the women. Among the men there is
some drunkenness, but not among the women,
though they are the chief distillers of spirits. Men
and women work together, usually at the same
occupations. We learn that the Khasis have an
unusual love of nature, and are fond of music; thus
they have names for birds and flowers, also for
many butterflies and moths. These are traits not
usually found in the people of India.</p>

<p>There is a point to note of special interest in their
language. All the nouns have a masculine and a
feminine gender, and the feminine nouns immensely
predominate. The sun is feminine, the moon
masculine. In the pronouns there is one form
only in the plural, and that is feminine. It may
seem that these matters&mdash;noted so briefly&mdash;are
unimportant; but it is such little things that deserve
attentive study. At least they serve to show
that the Khasis have reached a high level of primitive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
culture; and they indicate further the strong importance
of the feminine idea, which is the main
interest in our inquiry.</p>

<p>A few words must be said about the organisation
of the tribes. These tribes are formed in sections&mdash;of
which the chief are the Khasi, Synteng, and
War. Each section or tribe is divided into clans
and sub-clans; these are strictly exogamous. To
marry within the clan is the greatest sin a Khasi
can commit. This would explain the strict reckoning
of descent through the mothers.</p>

<p>The Khasi clan grew from the family. There is
a saying common among the people, <i>Long jaid ne
ka kynthei</i>, &#8220;From the woman sprang the tribe.&#8221;
All the clans trace their descent from ancestresses
(grandmothers) who are called <i>Ki Iwabei Tynrai</i>,
literally, <i>grandmothers of the root</i>, i.&nbsp;e. <i>the root of the
tree of the clan</i>. In some clans the name of the
ancestress survives, as, for instance, <i>Kyngas houning</i>,
&#8220;the sweet one.&#8221; <i>Ka Iaw shubde</i> is the ancestress
of the Synteng tribe, and it is curious to note that
she is credited with having first introduced the art
of smelting iron. She is also said to have founded
a market in which she successfully traded in cattle.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>It is hardly possible to exaggerate the esteem in
which the tribal ancestress is held; she is so greatly
reverenced that she may truly be said to be deified.
In such worship rests the foundation of the deep
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>tribal piety. <i>Ka Iawbei</i>, &#8220;the first mother,&#8221; has
the foremost place of honour by her side, and acting
as her agent is <i>U Suid Nia</i>, her brother. There is
another fact to show the honour in which the female
ideal is held. The flat memorial stones set up to
perpetuate the memory of the dead are called after
the mothers of the clan, while the standing stones
ranged behind them are dedicated to the male
kinsmen on the female side. These table stones
are exceedingly interesting. They are exactly like
the long stones and dolmens which are found in
Brittany, in Ireland, in Galicia in Spain, and other
parts of Europe. Is it possible that some of these
memorials, whose history has been lost, were also
set up to commemorate the mothers of tribes?
But be this as it may, among the Khasis, where
ancient custom and tradition have been preserved,
goddesses are more important than gods. Almost
all the other deities to whom propitiation is offered
are female. Male personages also figure, and among
them <i>Thaulang</i>, the husband, is revered.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Still the
chief divinity rests in the goddesses; the gods are
represented only in their relation to them. The
powers of sickness and death are all female, and
these are most frequently worshipped. Again, the
protectors of the household are goddesses. I wish
that I had space to write of their curious, yet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>beautiful, religious rites. The sacrifices are communal
in character; they are offered in times of
sickness and when dangers threaten the clan.
Priestesses assist at all sacrifices and the male
officiants act only as their agents. The household
sacrifices are always performed by women.</p>

<p>Consider what this placing of their goddesses
rather than their gods&mdash;of the priestess rather than
priest&mdash;in the forefront of their worship signifies!
Very plainly it reflects honour on the sex to which
the supreme deities belong. We need no clearer
proof of the high status of women among this people.
Such customs are certainly survivals<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> from the
time of a more primitive matriarchate, when the
priestess was the agent for the performance of all
religious ceremonies. In one state a priestess still
performs the sacrifices on the appointment of a
new Siem, or ruler. Another such survival is the
High Priestess of Nongkrem, in the Synteng district,
who &#8220;combines in her person sacerdotal and
regal functions.&#8221; In this state the tradition runs
that the first High Priestess was <i>Ka Pah Synten</i>,
&#8220;the flower-lured one.&#8221; She was a beautiful
maiden, who had her abode in a cave at Marai, near
Nongkrem whence she was enticed by means of a
flower. She was taken by her lover to be his bride,
and she became not only the first High Priestess of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>Nongkrem, but also the mother of the Siems of
Nongkrem.</p>

<p>It must be noted that the Siems or rulers of
the states are always men. They are chosen from
the eldest sister&#8217;s children. Possibly the case of the
High Priestess of Nongkrem, who is the nominal
head of the state, points to an earlier period of rule
by women; but to-day the temporal power is
delegated to one of her sons or nephews, who becomes
the Siem. I need not labour this question overmuch;
it is actualities I wish to deal with. As I
have repeatedly said, there is no sure ground for
believing that the maternal system involves rule by
women. This may have happened in some cases,
but I do not think that it can ever have been
common. I am very certain, however, of the error
in the view which accepts the subordination of
women as the common condition among barbarous
peoples, whereas there are indications and proofs
in all directions of a more or less strong assertiveness
on their part, and always in the direction of
social unity and sexual regulation. The fact that
the maternal system resulted in the limitation of
the freedom of the male members of the family is,
in my opinion, to be attributed to those powerful
female qualities which exercised an immense influence
on early societies. Regarding what has been
said, I think it cannot be denied that while individual
rights were of far more importance to the males,
the idea of the family and social rights were, in
their turn, essentially feminine sentiments. Thus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
it was in the women&#8217;s interest to consolidate the
family, and by means of this their own power; and
they succeeded in doing so to an extraordinary
extent in primitive communities, without help of
the maternal customs, which, as I have tried to
make clear, arose out of the conditions of the
primordial family and by the action of the united
mothers. If I am right, then, here is the primary
cause of the women&#8217;s position of authority in the
communal maternal family.</p>

<p>I am very certain of the rights such a system
conferred upon women; rights that are impossible
under the patriarchal family, which involves the
subordination of the woman to her father first and
afterward to her husband. In proof of this let us
now consider marriage and divorce, the laws of
inheritance, and other customs of the Khasis. And
first we may note that polygamy&mdash;the distinctive
custom of the patriarchs&mdash;does not exist; as Mr.
Gurdon remarks, &#8220;such a practice would not be in
vogue among a people who observe the matriarchate.&#8221;
This is the more remarkable as the Khasi
women considerably outnumber the men. In 1901
there were 1118 females to 1000 males. At the
present time the people are monandrists. There
are instances of men having wives other than those
they regularly marry, but the practice is not common.
Such wives are called &#8220;stolen wives,&#8221; and
their children are said &#8220;to be from the top,&#8221; <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
from the branches of the clan and not the root.
In the War country the children of the &#8220;stolen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
wife&#8221; enjoy an equal share in the father&#8217;s property
with the children of the regular wife. Polyandry
is said to be practised, but the fact is not mentioned
by Mr. Gurdon; in any case it can prevail only
among the poorer sort, with whom, too, it would
often seem to mean rather facility of divorce than
the simultaneous admission of plurality of husbands.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>The courtship customs of Khasi youths and
maidens are simple and beautiful. The young
people meet at the dances in the spring-time, when
the girls choose their future husbands. There is no
practice among the Khasis of exchange of daughters;
and there is an entire absence of the patriarchal
idea of their women as property. Marriage is a
simple contract, unaccompanied by any ceremony.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
After marriage the husband lives with his wife in
her mother&#8217;s home. Of late years a new custom
has arisen, and now in the Khasi tribe, when one
or two children have been born, and <i>if the marriage
is a happy one</i>, the couple frequently leave the
family home, and set up housekeeping for themselves.
When this is done, husband and wife pool
their earnings for the support of the family. This
is clearly a departure from the maternal marriage,
a step in the direction of father-right. Among the
Syntengs, the people who have most closely preserved
the customs of the matriarchate, the husband
does not even go to live with his wife, he only visits
her in her mother&#8217;s home. In Jow&aacute;y this rule is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>so strict that the husband comes only after dark.
He is not permitted to sleep, to eat, or smoke during
his visit&mdash;the idea being that as none of his earnings
go to support the home, he must not partake of food
or any refreshment. Here is a curious instance of
etiquette preserving these clandestine visits long
after the time when such secrecy was necessary.
We may note another survival among the Syntengs.
The father is commonly called by the name of the
first child, thus, the father of a child called Bobon,
becomes Pa-bobon.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> This does not, I am sure,
point back to a period when paternity was uncertain,
rather, it is an effort to establish the social
relation of the father to the family, and is connected
with domestic and property considerations, not at
all with relationship. The proof of this will appear
in a later chapter.</p>

<p>Very striking are the conditions attaching to
divorce. Again we find the right of separation
granted equally to both sexes, a significant indication
of the high position of women. Marriage being
regarded as an agreement between wife and husband,
the tie may be broken without any question of disgrace.
But although divorce is frequent and easy,
and can be claimed for a variety of reasons, all who
have dwelt among the Khasis testify to the durable
and happy marriages among them. Only when they
find it impossible to live amicably together do a
couple agree to separate. In this event the children
always remain with the mother. For their mothers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>the children cherish a very strong affection, for all
their sympathies and affection bind them to her and
her family.</p>

<p>The conditions of divorce vary in the separate
tribes. Among the Khasis both parties must agree
to the dissolution of the tie. With the Synteng
and War tribes such mutual consent is not necessary,
but the partner who claims release from the other,
without his or her consent, must pay compensation.
A woman cannot be divorced during pregnancy.
The form of divorce is simple; among the Khasis
it consists of the exchange of five cowries. This is
done in the presence of witnesses, and the ceremony
must take place in the open air. Then a crier goes
around the village to proclaim the divorce, using
the following words&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;<i>Kaw</i>&mdash;hear, oh villagers! that&mdash;U and K have
been separated in the presence of the elders. <i>Hei!</i>
thou, oh young men, canst go and make love to
K&mdash;for she is now unmarried, and thou, oh maidens,
canst make love to U&mdash;<i>Hei!</i> there is no let or
hindrance from henceforth.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>And here I would pause, although it leads me a
little aside, to make a point that to me seems to
be of special importance. Obviously this simple
divorce by mutual consent was made easy in its
working by the maternal system. The great drawback
to the dissolution of the marriage tie in the
patriarchal family is the effect it has on the lives
of the children; but in the maternal family such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
evil does not exist, for the children always live with
the mother and take her name. By saying this, I
do not wish to imply that I am necessarily recommending
such a system, but that it had its advantages
for the mother and her children, I think, cannot
be denied. Its failure arises, as is evident, from the
alien position of the father in relation to his children.</p>

<p>In the primitive maternal family the place of the
father, to a great extent, is filled by the maternal
uncle. Among the Khasis he is regarded in the
light of a father. It is his duty to assist the mother
in the management of the family. The husband is
looked upon merely as <i>u shong kha</i>,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> a begetter.
Only by the later marriage custom, when the wife
and children leave the home of her mother, has the
father any recognised position in the home. &#8220;There
is no gainsaying the fact,&#8221; writes Mr. Gurdon, &#8220;that
the husband is a stranger in the wife&#8217;s home, and
it is certain he can take no part in the rites and
ceremonies of his wife&#8217;s family.&#8221;</p>

<p>The important status assigned to women becomes
clearer when we consider the laws of inheritance.
Daughters inherit, not sons. The youngest daughter
is heiress to the family property, but the other
daughters are entitled to a share on the mother&#8217;s
death. No man can possess property unless it is
self-acquired. Among the Synteng, such property
on the man&#8217;s death goes to his mother. This would
seem to be the primitive custom. There is now a
provision that, if the wife undertakes not to re-marry
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>she has half of her husband&#8217;s property, which descends
to her youngest daughter. In the Khasi
states a man&#8217;s property, if acquired before his
marriage, goes to his mother, but what is gained
afterwards goes to the wife, for the youngest
daughter. Only in the War country do the sons
inherit from the father with the daughters, but
something in addition is given to the youngest
daughter. The family property always descends
in the female line. For this reason, daughters are
of more importance than sons. A family without
daughters dies out, which among the Khasis is the
greatest calamity, as there is no one qualified to
bury the dead and perform the religious rites.
Thus both the Khasis and the Syntengs have a plan
of adoption. The male members of any family, if
left without females, are allowed to call in a young
girl from another family to perform the family
religious ceremonies. She takes the place of the
youngest daughter, and becomes the head of the
household. She inherits the ancestral property.</p>

<p>In the face of these facts it can hardly be denied
that mother-right and mother-power among the
Khasis are still very much alive. Here at least
descent through the mother does involve power to
women, and confers exceptional rights, especially
as regards inheritance. I have already called
attention to the equality of the women with men
in the code of sexual morality. This is so important
that it is worth while to follow it a little further.
That freedom in love carries with it domestic and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
social rights and privileges to women I have no
longer to prove. We found the same freedom under
the maternal family among the Iroquois and Zu&ntilde;i
Indians: there courtship was in the hands of the
woman; there also divorce was free, and a couple
would rather separate than live together inharmoniously.
I have given proof of the happy
domestic life of these peoples. Equality in the
sexual relationships has always been closely associated
with the status of women. Wherever divorce
is difficult, there woman&#8217;s lot is hard, and her
position low. It is part of the patriarchal custom
which regards the man as the owner of the woman.
It would be easy to prove this by the history of
marriage in the races of the past, as also by an
examination of the present divorce laws in civilised
countries. I cannot do this, but I make the assertion
without the least shadow of doubt. &#8220;Free
divorce is the charter of Woman&#8217;s Freedom.&#8221; I
would point back in proof to these examples of
the maternal family, foremost among whose privileges
is this equality of partnership in marriage.
Here you have before you, solved by these primitive
peoples, some of the most urgent questions that
yet have to be faced by us to-day. To hear of
peoples who live gladly, and without those problems
that are rotting away our civilisation, brings a new
courage to those of us, who sometimes grow hopeless
at our own needless wastage of love and life.</p>

<p>I must not say more upon this question, though
it is one that tempts me strongly. It is not,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
however, my purpose in this book to offer opinions of
my own on these problems of the relations of the
two sexes; I prefer to leave the facts of the mother-age
to speak for themselves. Those whose eyes are
not blinded will not fail to see.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<h3>FURTHER EXAMPLES OF THE MATERNAL FAMILY</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Pursuing</span> our inquiry into the social organisation
of mother-right, an interesting example occurs
among the peoples of the Malay States, where,
notwithstanding the centres of Hindu and Moslem
influence, much has been retained of the maternal
system, once universally prevalent. The maternal
marriage, here known as the <i>ambel-anak</i>, in which
the husband lives with the wife, paying nothing to
the support of the family and occupying a subordinate
position, may be taken as typical of the
former condition. But among the tribes who have
come in contact with outside influences the custom
of the husband visiting the wife, or residing in her
house, is modified, and in some cases has altogether
disappeared.</p>

<p>From a private correspondent, a resident in the
Malay States, I have received some interesting notes
about the present conditions of the native tribes
and the position of women. &#8220;In most of the Malay
States exogamous matriarchy has in comparatively
modern times been superseded by feudalism (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>,
the patriarchal rights of the father). But where the
old customs survive, the women are still to a large<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
extent in control. The husband goes to live in the
wife&#8217;s village; thus the women in each group are a
compact unity, while the men are strangers to each
other and enter as unorganised individuals. This
is the real basis of the women&#8217;s power. In other
tribes, where the old customs have changed, the
women occupy a distinctly inferior position, and
under the influence of Islam the idea of secluding
adult women has been for centuries spreading and
increasing in force.&#8221; Here, again, clear proof is
shown of the maternal system exercising a direct
influence on the position of women. And this
statement is in agreement with Robertson Smith,
who, in writing of the maternal marriage, says: &#8220;And
it is remarkable that when both customs&mdash;the
woman receiving her husband in her own hut, and
the man taking his wife to his&mdash;occur side by side
among the same people, descent in the former case
is traced through the mother, in the latter through
the father.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>In its ancient form the maternal communal
family has notably persisted among the Padang
Highlanders of Sumatra. These people live in
village communities, with long timber houses placed
in barrack-like rows, very similar to the communal
dwellings of the American Indians. The houses are
gay in appearance, and are adorned with carved and
coloured woodwork. One dwelling will contain as
many as a hundred people, who form a <i>sa-mandei</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>or mother-hood. Again we find the family consisting
of the house-mother and her descendants in the
female line&mdash;sons and daughters, and the daughters&#8217;
children. McGee thus describes these maternal
households&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;If the visitor, mounting the ladder steps, looks
in at one of the doors of the separate dwellings, he
may see seated beyond the family hearth the mother
and her children, eating the midday meal, and very
likely the father, who may have been doing a turn
of work in his wife&#8217;s rice-plot. If he is a kindly
husband, he is there much as a friendly visitor, but
his real home remains in the house in which he was
born.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The husband has no permanent residence in the
woman&#8217;s house, and at dusk each evening the men
may be seen walking across the village to join their
wives and families. The father has no rights over
his children, who belong wholly to the wife&#8217;s <i>suku</i>,
or clan. But this in no way implies that the father
is unknown, for monogamy is the rule; as is usual
the question is one rather of social right than of
relationship. The maternal uncle is the male head
of the house, and exercises under the mother the
duties of a father to the children. The brother of the
eldest grandmother is the male head of the family
settlement and the clan consists of a number of
these families. It would seem that these male
rulers act as the agents of the female members,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>whose authority is great. This power is dependent
on the inheritance; as is the descent, so is the property,
and its transmission is arranged for the benefit
of the maternal lineage. For this reason daughters
are preferred rather than sons.</p>

<p>This account of the Padang Malays may be
supplemented by the Jesuit missionary De Mailla&#8217;s
description of the maternal marriage in the Island
of Formosa.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Speaking of this marriage, McGee
says: &#8220;If it had received the notice it deserves, it
might long ago have placed the study of maternal
institutions on a sounder basis.&#8221;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The Formosan youth wishing to marry makes
music day by day at the maid&#8217;s door, till, if willing,
she comes out to him, and when they are agreed,
the parents are told, and the marriage feast is
prepared in the bride&#8217;s house, whence the bridegroom
returns no more to his father, regarding his
father-in-law&#8217;s house as his own, and himself as the
support of it, while his own father&#8217;s house is no more
to him than in Europe the bride&#8217;s home is henceforth
to her when she quits it to live with her husband.
Thus the Formosans set no store on sons, but aspire
to have daughters, who procure them sons-in-law to
become the support of their old age.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>It will be noted that here the house is spoken of as
the father&#8217;s, and not as belonging to the mother.
The bridegroom is the suitor, and we see the creeping
in of property considerations always associated with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>the rise of father-right. Though the husband has
as yet no recognised position and lives in the wife&#8217;s
home, he is valued for his service to his father-in-law,
clearly a step in the direction of property
assertion. Among many of the Malay hill tribes
of Formosa the maternal system is dying out,
though the old law forbidding marriage within the
clan remains in force.</p>

<p>These changes must be expected wherever the
transition towards father-right has begun; the
older forms of courtship and marriage, so favourable
to the woman, are replaced by patriarchal customs.
One or two curious examples of primitive courtship,
in which the initiative is taken entirely by the girl
may be noted here. Among the Garos tribe it is not
only the privilege, but the duty of the girl to select
her lover, while an infringement of this rule is
severely and summarily punished. Any declaration
made on the part of the young man is regarded as an
insult to the whole <i>mah&aacute;ri</i> (motherhood) to which
the girl belongs, a stain only to be expiated by
liberal presents made at the expense of the <i>mah&aacute;ri</i>
of the over-forward lover. The marriage customs
are equally curious. On the morning of the wedding
a ceremony very similar to capture takes place, only
it is the bridegroom who is abducted. He pretends
to be unwilling and runs away and hides, but he
is caught by the friends of the bride. Then he is
taken by force, weeping as he goes, in spite of the
resistance and counterfeited grief of his parents and
friends, to the bride&#8217;s house, where he takes up his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
residence with his mother-in-law. It is instructive
to find that these marriages are usually successful.
Although divorce is easy, it is not frequent. &#8220;The
Garos will not hastily make engagements, because,
when they do make them, they intend to keep
them.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>In Paraguay, we are told, the women are generally
endowed with stronger passions than the men, and
are allowed to make the proposals.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> So also among
the Ahitas of the Philippine Islands, where, if her
clan-parents will not consent to a love match the
girl seizes the young man by the hair, carries him
off, and declares she has run away with him. In
such a case it appears the marriage is held to be
valid whether the parents consent or not.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> A
similar custom of a gentler character, is practised
by the Tarrahumari Indians of Northern Mexico,
among whom, according to Lumboltz, the maiden
is a persistent wooer employing a <i>r&eacute;pertoire</i> of
really exquisite love songs to soften the heart of a
reluctant swain.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Again, in New Guinea, where
the women held a very independent position, &#8220;the
girl is always regarded as the seducer. Women
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>steal men.&#8221; A youth who proposed to a girl would
be making himself ridiculous, would be called a
woman, and laughed at by the girls. The usual
method by which a girl proposes is to send a present
to the youth by a third party, following this up by
repeated gifts of food; the young man sometimes
waits a month or two, receiving presents all the time,
in order to assure himself of the girl&#8217;s constancy,
before decisively accepting her advances.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>It is clear that these cases, which I have chosen
from a number of similar courtship customs, differ
very much from what is our idea of the customary
r&ocirc;le of the girl and her lover. To me they are very
instructive. They show the error of the long-held
belief in the passivity of the female as a natural law
of the sex.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Such openness of conduct in courtship
is impossible except where women hold an entirely
independent position. Here, then, is another advantage
that may be claimed as arising for women
out of the maternal system. I claim this: the
woman&#8217;s right of selection in love&mdash;yes, her greatest
right, one that is necessary for a freer and more
beautiful mating.</p>

<p>Terminating this short digression, I return to my
examination of the peoples among whom the family
is especially maternal.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p><p>The Pelew Islanders of the South Sea have customs
in many respects the same as those of the Khasi
tribes. They preserve strict maternal descent,
and like the Khasis, the deities of all the clans are
goddesses. The life and social habits of the people
have been described by Kubary, a careful and
sympathetic observer, for long resident in the
island.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> The tribes are divided into exogamous
clans, and intermarriage between any relations on
the mother&#8217;s side is unlawful. These clans are
grouped together in villages and the life is of a
communal character. Each village consists of
about a score of clans, and forms with its lands a
petty independent state.</p>

<p>Again we find the maternal system intimately
connected with religious ideas, and it is interesting
to recall what was said by Bachofen: &#8220;Wherever
gyn&aelig;cocracy meets us the mystery of religion is
bound up with it, and lends to motherhood an incorporation
in some divinity.&#8221; Among these
Islanders every family traces its descent from a
woman&mdash;the common mother of the clan. And
for this reason the members worship a goddess and
not a god. In the different states there are, besides
other special deities, usually a goddess and a god,
but as these are held to be derived directly from a
household-goddess, it is evident that here, as among
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>the Khasis, goddesses are older than the gods.
This is shown also by the names of the goddesses.
There is another fact of interest: some women are
reputed to be the wives of the gods, they are called
<i>Amalalieys</i> and have a great honour paid to them,
while their children pass for the offspring of the
gods.</p>

<p>The reverence paid to the ancestral goddesses is
explained by Mr. Kubary as arising from the importance
of women in the clans.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The existence of the clan depends entirely on the
life of the women, and not at all on the life of the
men. If the women survive, it is no matter though
every man in the clan should perish, for the women
will, as usual, marry men of another clan, and their
offspring will inherit their mother&#8217;s clan, and thereby
prolong its existence. Whereas if the women of the
clan die out the clan necessarily becomes extinct,
even if every man in it should survive; for the men
must, as usual, marry women of another clan, and
their offspring will inherit their mother&#8217;s clan and
not the clan of the father, which accordingly, with
the death of the father, is wiped off the community.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>I quote this passage because it shows so clearly
what I am claiming, that descent through the
mother, under the condition of strict exogamy,
conferred a very marked distinction on the female
members of the clan, whose existence depended on
them; this cannot possibly have failed to act
favourably on their position. I may note, too, in
passing, the fallacy of Mr. McLennan&#8217;s view that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
polyandry (which, it will be remembered, he held
to have been developed from and connected with
mother-descent) arose as a result of female infanticide.
Such a practice is clearly impossible in
clans whose existence depends on the life of its
female members; daughters among them are prized
more highly than sons.</p>

<p>The case we are now examining affords the
strongest confirmation of the honour paid to women
under the strict maternal system. Take alone the
titles that these Pelew islanders give to their women,
as <i>Adhal&aacute;l a pel&uacute;</i>, &#8220;mothers of the land,&#8221; and <i>Adhal&aacute;l
a blay</i>, &#8220;mothers of the clan.&#8221; The testimony
of those who know their customs is that the women
enjoy complete equality with the men in every
respect. Mr. Kubary affirms the predominance of
female influence in all the social life of the clan.
He asserts, without qualification, that the women
both politically and socially enjoy a position superior
to that of the men. The eldest women in the clans
exercise the most decisive influence in the conduct
of affairs; the head men do nothing without full
consultation with them, and their power extends to
affairs of state and even to foreign politics. No
chief would venture to come to a decision without
the approval of the mothers of the families. As
one consequence of this power the women have clubs
of association similar to the clubs of men that are
common in so many tribes. A curious privilege
given to women is recorded: &#8220;The women have an
unlimited privilege of striking, fining, or if it be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
done on the spot, killing any man who makes his
way into their bathing places.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>The marriage customs I shall pass over briefly,
as they are similar to those of other tribes under the
maternal system, though changes may be noted,
such, for instance, as presents in the form of a kind
of bride-price being given by the bridegroom to the
parents of the bride. This is not a maternal custom,
and although half of such presents belongs by right
to the girl, it is clearly a form of wife-purchase.
Then polygamy is practised, though it is expressly
stated to be uncommon.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> There is now a marriage
ceremony. Divorce still remains free, and the
conditions are favourable for the wife. Jealousy is
said to be prevalent both among the men and the
women. The wedding monologue is interesting
and indicates the relative position of the female and
male members of the family. The salutation is as
follows&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Hei, thou, oh mother; oh grandmothers; oh
maternal uncle; oh elder grandmother; oh younger
grandfather; oh elder grandfather! As the flesh
has fallen the ring has been put on.... You will
all of you give ear [the ancestresses and ancestors]
you will continue giving strength and spirit that
they [the bride and bridegroom] may be well.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>There is left an important fact to consider, which
explains the persistence of the women&#8217;s authority
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>under marriage conditions much less favourable
than the complete maternal form. The Pelew
women have another source of power; their position
has an industrial as well as a kinship basis. In
this island the people subsist mainly on the produce
of their taro fields, and the cultivation of this, their
staple food, is carried out by the women alone. And
this identification of women with the industrial
process has without doubt contributed materially
to the predominance of female influence on the social
life of the people. Wherever the control over the
means of production is in the hands of women, we
find them exercising influence and even authority.
Among these islanders the women do not merely
bestow life on the people, they also work to obtain
that which is most essential for the preservation of
life, and therefore they are called &#8220;mothers of the
land.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Now, considering this honour paid to the
Pelew women, it is clearly impossible to regard their
work in cultivating the taro as a sign of their subordinate
position in the social order. The facts of
primitive life are often mistaken. This is a question
to which I shall refer again in a later chapter.</p>

<p>In the same way among the Pani Kotches, tribes
of Bengal, we find the women in a privileged position,
due to their greater industrial activity and
intelligence.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;It is the women&#8217;s business to dig the soil,
to sow and plant, as well as to spin, weave and
brew beer; they refuse no task, and leave only the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>coarsest labour to the men. The mother of the
family marries her daughter at an early age; at
the feast of betrothal she dispenses half as much
again to the bride as to the bridegroom-elect. As
for the grown-up girls and the widows, they know
very well how to find husbands; the wealthy never
lack partners. The chosen one goes to reside with
his mother-in-law, who both reigns and governs,
with her daughter for prime minister. If the
consort permits himself to incur expenses without
special authorisation, he must meet them as best
he can. Fathers of families have been known to be
sold as slaves, the wives refusing to pay the penalties
they incurred. Under these circumstances, it was
lawful for them to marry again.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p></div>

<p>Here, as among the Pelew islanders, special
industrial conditions are combined with the maternal
system, and as a result we find what may, perhaps,
be termed &#8220;an economic matriarchy.&#8221; Another
cause of authority, quite as powerful, is the possession
by women of inherited property. Among
barbarous peoples the importance of this is not so
great, but where mother-descent has, for any reason,
been maintained up to a time when individual
possession has been developed and property is
large, we meet with a remarkable &#8220;pecuniary
matriarchate,&#8221; based on the women holding the
magic power of money.</p>

<p>An example may be found in the interesting
Touaregs of the Sahara, a race very far advanced
in civilisation, who, even at the present day, have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>preserved their independence and many of their
ancient customs. Among them all relationship is
still maternal and confers both rank and inheritance.
&#8220;The child follows the blood of the mother,&#8221; and
the son of a slave or serf father and a noble woman
is noble. &#8220;It is the womb which dyes the child,&#8221;
the Touaregs say in their primitive language.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> All
property descends only through the mother, and by
means of accumulation the greatest part of the
fortune of the community is in the hands of women.
This is the real basis of the women&#8217;s power. &#8220;Absolute
mistress of her fortune, her actions, and her
children, who belong to her and bear her name, the
Targui woman goes where she will and exercises a
real authority.&#8221; The unusual position of the wife
is significantly indicated by the fact that, although
polygamy is permitted by the law, she practically
enforces monogamy, for the conditions of divorce are
so favourable for a woman that she can at once
separate from a husband who attempts to give her
a rival. Again the initiative in courtship is taken
by the woman, who chooses from her suitors the
one whom she herself prefers.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>It is interesting to note that the Targui women
know how to read and write in greater numbers
than the men. Duveyrier states that to them is due
the preservation of the ancient Libyan and Berber
writings.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> &#8220;Leaving domestic work to their slaves,
the Targui ladies occupy themselves with reading,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>writing, music and embroidery; they live as intelligent
aristocrats.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> &#8220;The ladies of the tribe of
Ifoghas, in particular, are renowned for their <i>savoirvivre</i>
and their musical talent; they know how to
ride <i>mehari</i> better than all their rivals. Secure
in their cages, they can ride races with the most
intrepid cavaliers, if one may give this name to
riders on dromedaries; in order, also, to keep
themselves in practice in this kind of riding, they
meet to take short trips together, going wherever
they like without the escort of any man.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> In the
tribe of Imanan, who are descended from the ancient
sultans, the women are given the title <i>Timan&ocirc;kal&icirc;n</i>,
&#8220;royal women,&#8221; on account of their beauty and
their talent in the art of music. They often give
concerts, to which the men come &#8220;from long
distances&mdash;decked out like male ostriches.&#8221; In
these concerts the women improvise the songs,
accompanying themselves on the tambourine and
a sort of violin or <i>reb&acirc;za</i>. They are much sought
after in marriage, because of the title of <i>cherif</i> which
they confer on their children.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>There is a touch of chivalrous sentiment in the
relations between men and women.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> &#8220;If a woman
is married,&#8221; Duveyrier tells us, &#8220;she is honoured
all the more in proportion to the number of her
masculine friends, but she must not show preference
to any one of them. The lady may embroider on
the cloak, or write on the shield of her chevalier,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>verses in his praise and wishes for his good fortune.
Her friend may, without being censured, cut the
name of the lady on the rocks or chant her virtues.
&#8216;Friends of different sexes,&#8217; say the Touaregs, &#8216;are
for the eyes and heart, and not for the bed only, as
among the Arabs.&#8217;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Letourneau, in quoting these
passages from Duveyrier, makes the following
comment: &#8220;Such customs as these indicate delicate
instincts, which are absolutely foreign to the Arabs.
They strongly remind us of the times of our southern
troubadours and of the <i>cours d&#8217;amour</i>, which were
the quintessence of chivalry.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>The foregoing example is exceedingly interesting;
it shows women holding the position that as a rule
belongs to men, and is thus worthy of most careful
study, but at the same time we must guard against
according it a general value which it does not possess.
Such a case is exceptional, though it by no means
stands alone, and the social position of Targui women
is analogous to that of the women of ancient Egypt.
It is important to note that their great independence
arose through the persistence of maternal descent,
and could not have been maintained apart from that
system, which placed in their hands the strong power
of wealth. Here, then, is certain proof of the
favourable influence mother-descent may exercise
on the status of women. It is because of this I have
brought forward this example of the Targui women.</p>

<p>Enough has now been said. I have examined
the institution of the maternal family, both in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>early communal stage and also under later social
conditions, where, in certain cases, mother-descent
has been maintained. In all the examples cited I
have given the marriage customs and domestic
habits of the people as they are testified to by
authorities whose records cannot be questioned.
Many similar examples, it may be said, might be
brought forward from other races, and the proof
of mother-right and mother-power greatly strengthened
thereby. There is, however, so much similarity
in the maternal family, so much correspondence in
the marriage forms and social habits prevailing
among races widely separated, that the points of
difference are little in comparison with those they
have in common. My object is not so much to
exhaust the subject as to bring into relief the radical
differences between the maternal communal clan,
with its social life centred around the mothers, and
the opposite patriarchal form in which the solitary
family is founded on the individual father. I hold
that, other conditions being equal, the one system is
favourable to the authority of women, the other to
the authority of men. The facts which have been
cited are, I submit, amply sufficient to support this
view.</p>

<p>We have seen that the life of the maternal clan is
dependent on the women&mdash;and not upon the men;
we have noted that the inheritance of the family
name and the family property passing through the
women adds considerably to their importance, and
that daughters are preferred to sons. We have
found women the organisers of the households, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
guardians of the household stores, and the distributors
of food, under a social organisation that
may be termed &#8220;a communal matriarchy.&#8221; More
important than all else, we have noted the remarkable
freedom of women in the sexual relationships; in
courtship they are permitted to take the active
part; in marriage their position is one of such power
that, sometimes, they are able to impose the form
of the marriage; in divorce they enjoy equal, and
even superior, rights of separation; moreover, they
are always the owners and controllers of the children.
Nor is the influence of women restricted to the
domestic sphere. We have found them the advisers,
and in some cases the dictators, in the social organisation
under the headmen of the clan. Then we
examined the cases in which the women&#8217;s power has
an industrial as well as a kinship basis, and have
proved the existence of an &#8220;economic matriarchy.&#8221;
And further even than this, we have found women
the sole possessors of accumulated wealth, and noted
that, under the favourable conditions of such a
&#8220;pecuniary matriarchy,&#8221; they are able to obtain a
position in learning and the arts excelling that of
the men. We have even seen goddesses set above
the gods, and women worshipped as deities.</p>

<p>Now I submit to the judgment of my readers&mdash;what
do these examples of mother-right show, if not
that, broadly speaking, women were the dominant
force in this stage of the family. No doubt too
much importance may be attached to the idea of
women ruling. This is an error I have tried to
guard against. My aim throughout has been to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
establish mother-right, not mother-rule. I believe
it is only by an extraordinary power of illusion that
we can recognise, in the favourable position of
women under mother-descent Bachofen&#8217;s view of
an Amazonian gyn&aelig;cocracy. But this does not
weaken at all my position. I maintain that such
customs of courtship, marriage and divorce, of
property inheritance and possession, and of the
domestic and social rights, as those we have seen in
the cases examined, afford conclusive proof of
women&#8217;s power in the maternal family. If this is
denied, the only conclusion that suggests itself to me
is that, those who seek to diminish the power of
mother-right have done so in reinforcement of a
preconceived idea of the superiority of the man as
the natural and unchanging order in the relationships
of the sexes. One suspects prejudice here. To
approach this question with any fairness, it is
absolutely essential to clear the mind from the
current theories regarding the family. The order
is not sacred in the sense that it has always had the
same form. It is this belief in the immutability of
our form of marriage and the family which accounts
for the prejudice with which this question is approached.
The modern civilised man cannot easily
accustom himself to the idea that in the maternal
family the dominion of the mother was regarded as
the natural, and, therefore, the right and accepted
order of the family. It is very difficult for us even
to believe in a relationship of the mother and the
father that is so exactly opposite to that with which
we are accustomed.</p>

<h3>MOTHER-RIGHT CUSTOMS AND THE TRANSITION TO<br />
FATHER-RIGHT</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Endeavour</span> has been made in the previous
chapters to present the case for mother-right as
clearly and concisely as possible. The point we
have now reached is this: while mother-right does
not constitute or make necessary rule by women,
under that system they enjoy considerable power as
the result (1) of their organised position under the
maternal marriage among their own clan-kindred,
(2) of their importance to the male members of the
clan as the transmitters and holders of property.</p>

<p>It is necessary to remember the close connection
between these mother-right customs and the communal
clan, which was a free association for mutual
protection. This is a point of much interest. As
we have seen, the undivided family of the clan could
be maintained only by descent through the mothers,
since its existence depended on its power to retain
and protect all its members. In this way it destroyed
the solitary family, by its opposition to the
authority and will of the husband and father.</p>

<p>These conclusions will be strengthened as we
continue our examination of mother-right customs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
as we shall find them in all parts of the world. I
must select a few examples only and describe them
very briefly, not because these cases offer less
interest than the complete maternal families already
examined, but because of the length to which this
part of my inquiry is rapidly growing. The essential
fact to establish is the prevalence of mother-descent
as a probable universal stage in the past history of
mankind, and then to show the causes which, by
undermining the dominion of the maternal clan, led
to the adoption of father-right and the re-establishment
of the patriarchal family.</p>

<p>Let us begin with Australia, where the aboriginal
population is in a more primitive condition than any
other race whose institutions have been investigated.
I can notice a few facts only from the harvest of
information brought together by anthropologists
and travellers. The tribes are grouped into exogamous
sub-divisions, and each group has its own
land from which it takes a local name. Each group
wanders about on its own territory in order to hunt
game and collect roots, sometimes in detached
families and, less often, in larger hordes, for there
seems to be a tendency to local isolation. A
remarkable feature of the social organisation is found
in the more advanced tribes, where, in addition to
the division into clans, the group is divided into
male and female classes. All the members of such
clans regard themselves as kinsmen, or brothers and
sisters; they have the same totem mark and are
bound to protect each other. The totem bond is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
stronger than any blood tie, while the sex totems
are even more sacred than the clan totems.</p>

<p>Much confusion has arisen out of the attempts to
explain the Australian system; and for long the
close totem kinship was supposed to afford evidence
of group marriage, by which a man of one clan was
held to have sexual rights over all the women in
another clan. But further insight into their customs
has proved the error of such a view, which arose
from a misunderstanding of the terms of relationship
used among the tribes. Nowhere is marriage bound
by more severe laws; death is the penalty for sexual
intercourse with a person of a forbidden clan. And
it is certain that there is no evidence at all of communism
in wives.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>A system of taboos is very strongly established,
and as we should expect the women appear to be
most active in maintaining these sexual separations.
If a man, even by mistake, kills the sex-totem of the
women, they are as much enraged as if it were one
of their own children, and they will turn and attack
him with their long poles.</p>

<p>In Australia it is easy to recognise a very early
stage in human society. The organisation of the
family group into the clan is still taking place.
Moreover, the most primitive patriarchal conditions
have not greatly changed, for the males are great
individualists and cannot readily suffer the rights
of others than themselves. Mother-right can hardly
be said to exist, and the position of women is low.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>It is not the custom among any tribes for the husband
to reside in the home of the wife; this in itself is
sufficient to explain the power of the husbands.
Wives are frequently obtained by capture, and fights
for women are of common occurrence. Here it
would seem that progress has been very slow.
Indeed, it is the chief interest of the Australian
tribes that we can trace the transformation from the
early patriarchal conditions to the communal clan.</p>

<p>There is still another fact of very special interest.
In the large majority of tribes known to us descent
is traced through the mother; the proportion of
these tribes to those with father-descent being four
to one. Now, the question arises as to which of
these two systems is the earlier custom? As a rule
it is assumed that in all cases descent was originally
traced through the mother. But is this really so?
The evidence of the Australian tribes points to the
exact opposite opinion. For what do we find?
The tribes that have established mother-descent
have advanced further, with a more developed
social organisation, which could hardly be the case
if they were the more primitive. To this question
Starcke, in <i>The Primitive Family</i>, has drawn
particular attention; he regards &#8220;the female line
as a later development,&#8221; arrived at after descent
through the father was recognised, such change
being due to an urgent necessity which arose in the
primitive family for cohesion among its members,
making necessary sexual regulation and the maternal
clan.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>It is certainly difficult to decide on the priority
of this or that custom. But what is significant is
that in Australia the tribes which maintain the male
line of descent must be assigned to the lowest stage
of development. The rights established by marriage
among them are less clearly defined, and the use of
the totem marks, with the sexual taboos arising
from them, are less developed. Everything tends
to show that clan organisation and union in peace
have arisen with mother-descent, which cannot thus
be regarded as a survival from the earlier order, but
as a later development&mdash;a step forward in progress
and social regulation.</p>

<p>I take this as being exceedingly important: it
serves to establish what it has been my purpose to
show, that in the first stage the family was patriarchal&mdash;small
hostile groups living under the jealous
authority of the fathers; and that only as advancement
came did the maternal clan develop, since it
arose through a community of purpose binding all
its members in peace, and thereby controlling the
warring individual interests. The reasons for
mother-descent have been altogether misunderstood
by those who regard it as the earliest phase of the
family, and connect the custom with sexual disorder
and uncertainty of paternity. In all cases the clan
system shows a marked organisation, with a much
stronger cohesion than is possible in the restricted
family, which is held together by the force of the
father. It was within the clan that the rights of the
father and husband were endangered: he lost his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
position as supreme head of the family, and became
an alien member in a free association where his
position was strictly defined. The incorporation
of the family into the clan arose through the struggle
for existence forcing it into association; it was the
subordinate position of the husband under such a
system which finally made the women the rulers of
the household. If we regard the social conditions
of the maternal system as the first stage of development,
they are as difficult to understand as they
become intelligible when we consider it as a later and
beneficent phase in the growth of society.</p>

<p>This, then, I claim as the chief good of the maternal
system. As I see it, each advance in progress rests
on the conquest of sexual distrusts and fierceness
forcing into isolation. These jealous and odious
monopolist instincts have been the bane of humanity.
Each race must inevitably in the end outlive them;
they are the surviving relics of the ape and the tiger.
They arise out of that self-concentration and intensity
of animalism that binds the hands of men
and women from taking their inheritance. The
brute in us still resents association. Am I wrong
in connecting this individual monopolist idea of
My power! My right! with the paternal as opposed
to the maternal family? At any rate I find it
absent in the communal clan grouped around the
mothers, where the enlarged family makes common
cause and life is lived by all for and with each other.</p>

<p>An instructive example of the joint maternal
family is furnished by the Na&iuml;rs of Malabar, where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
we see a very late development of the clan system.
The family group includes many allied families, who
live together in large communal houses and possess
everything in common. There is common tenure of
land, over which the eldest male member of the
community presides; while the mother, and after
her death the eldest daughter, is the ruler in the
household. It is impossible to give the details of
their curious conjugal customs. The men do not
marry, but frequent other houses as lovers, without
ceasing to live at home, and without being in any
way detached from the maternal family. There is,
however, a symbolic marriage for every girl, by a
rite known as tying the <i>tali</i>; but this marriage
serves the purpose only of initiation, and the couple
separate after one day. When thus prepared for
marriage, a Na&iuml;r girl chooses her lovers, and any
number of unions may be entered upon without any
restrictions other than the strict prohibitions relative
to caste and tribe. These later marriages, unlike
the solemn initial rite, have no ceremony connected
with them, and are entered into freely at the will of
the woman and her family.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>Now, if we regard these customs in the light of
what has already been established, it is clear that
they cannot be regarded as the first stage in the
maternal family. Such a view is entirely to mistake
the facts. The Na&iuml;rs are in no respect a people of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>primitive culture. Through a long period they have
most strictly preserved the custom of matriarchal
heredity, which has led to an unusual concentration
of the family group, and it is probable that here is
the best explanation of the conjugal liberty of the
Na&iuml;r girls. However singular their system may
appear to us, it is the most logical and complete of
any polyandric system. If we compare it with the
more usual form of patriarchal polyandry we see
at once the influence of maternal descent. Here,
the woman makes a free choice of her husbands; in
no sense is she their property. It is common for
them to work for her, one husband taking on himself
to furnish her with clothes, another to give her rice
and food, and so on. It is, in fact, the wife who
possesses, and it is through her that wealth is transmitted.
In fraternal polyandry, on the other hand
(as, for instance, it is practised in Thibet and Ceylon),
the husbands of a woman are always brothers; she
belongs to them, and for her children there is a kind
of collective fatherhood. But among the Na&iuml;rs the
man as husband and father cannot be said to exist;
he is reduced to the most subordinate r&ocirc;le of the
male&mdash;he is simply the progenitor.</p>

<p>I know of no stronger case than this of the degraded
position of the father. And what I want to
make clear is that in such negation of all father-right
rested the inherent weakness in the matriarchal
conditions&mdash;a weakness which led eventually
to the re-establishment of the paternal family. We
must be very clear in our minds as to the sharp<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
distinction between the restricted family and the
communal clan. The clan as a confederation of
members was opposed to the family whose interests
were necessarily personal and selfish. Such communism,
to some may appear strange at so early a
stage of primitive cultures, yet, as I have more
than once pointed out, it was a perfectly natural
development; it arose through the fierce struggle
for existence, forcing the primitive hostile groups
to expand and unite with one another for mutual
protection. Such conditions of primitive socialism
were specially favourable for women. As I have
again and again affirmed, the collective motive was
more considered by the mothers, and must be sought
in the organisation of the maternal clan. But since
individual desires can never be wholly subdued, and
the male nature is ever directed towards self-assertion,
the clan, organised on the rights of the mothers,
had always to contend with an opposing force.
At one stage the clan was able to absorb the family,
but only under exceptional conditions could such a
system be maintained. The social organisation of
the clan was inevitably broken up as society advanced.
With greater security of life the individual
interests reasserted their power, and this undermined
the dominion of the mother.</p>

<p>To bring these facts home, we must now consider
some further examples of mother-right, in order to
show how closely these customs are connected with
the conditions of the maternal familiar clan.</p>

<p>The Yaos of Africa have what may be regarded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
as a matriarchal organisation. Kinship is reckoned
and property is inherited through the mother.
When a man marries, he is expected to live in his
wife&#8217;s village, and his first conjugal duties are to
build a house for her, and hoe a garden for her
mother. This gives the woman a very important
position, and it is she, and not the man, who usually
proposes marriage.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>In Africa descent through the mother is the rule,
though there are exceptions, and these are increasing.
The amusing account given by Miss Kingsley<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> of
Joseph, a member of the Batu tribe in French
Congo, strikingly illustrates the prevalence of the
custom. When asked by a French official to furnish
his own name and the name of his father, Joseph
was wholly nonplussed. &#8220;My fader!&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Who my fader?&#8221; Then he gave the name of his
mother. The case is the same among the negroes.
The Fanti of the Gold Coast may be taken as typical.
Among them an intensity of affection (accounted for
partly by the fact that the mothers have exclusive
care of the children) is felt for the mother, while the
father is almost disregarded as a parent, notwithstanding
the fact that he may be a wealthy and
powerful man. The practice of the Wamoimia,
where the son of a sister is preferred in legacies,
&#8220;because a man&#8217;s own son is only the son of his
wife,&#8221; is typical. The Bush husband does not live
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>with his wife, and often has wives in different
places.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>In Africa the clan system is firmly established,
which explains the prevalence of mother-descent.
Women, on the whole, take an important position,
and here, as elsewhere, their inheritance of property
enables them to maintain their equality with their
husbands. Individual possession of wealth is
allowed, but a married man usually cannot dispose
of any property unless his wife agrees, and she acts
as the representative of the children&#8217;s claims upon
the father. The privilege that, according to Laing,
the Soulima women have, of leaving their husbands
when they please, is also proof of the maternal
customs.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Moreover, among some tribes, the influence
of the mothers as the heads of families extends
to the councils of state; it is even said that
the chiefs do not decide anything without their
consent.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>Mother-right is still in force in many parts of
India, though owing to the influence of Brahminism
on the aboriginal tribes the examples of the maternal
family are fewer than might be expected. Among
the once powerful Koochs the women own all the
property, which is inherited from mother to daughter.
The husband lives with his wife and her mother, and,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>we are told, is subject to them. These women are
most industrious, weaving, spinning, planting and
sowing, in a word, doing all the work not above their
strength.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> The Koochs may be compared with the
Khasis, already noticed, and these maternal systems
among the Indian hill tribes may surely be regarded
as showing conditions at one time common. Even
tribes who have passed from the clan organisation
to the patriarchal family preserve numerous traces
of mother-right. Thus, the choice of her lover often
remains with the girl; again, divorce is easy at the
wish either of the woman or the man.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Such
freedom in love is clearly inconsistent with the
patriarchal authority of the husband. I must note
too the practice, common among many tribes, by
which the husband remains in the wife&#8217;s home for
a probationary period, working for her family.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
This is clearly a step towards purchase marriage, as
is proved by the Santals, where this service is
claimed when a girl is ugly or deformed and cannot
be married otherwise, while other tribes offer their
daughters when in want of labourers. This service-marriage
must not be confused with the true
maternal form, where the bridegroom visits or lives
with the wife and any service claimed is a test of
his fitness; it shows, however, the power of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>woman&#8217;s kindred still curbing the rights of the
husband.</p>

<p>The existence of mother-descent among the
peoples of Western Asia has been ascertained with
regard to some ancient tribes; but I may pass these
over, as they offer no points of special interest.
I must, however, refer briefly to the evidence brought
forward by the late Prof. Robertson Smith<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> of
mother-right in ancient Arabia. We find a decisive
example of its favourable influence on the position
of women in the custom of <i>beena</i> marriage. Under
this maternal form, the wife was not only freed from
any subjection involved by the payment of a bride-price
in the form of compulsory service or of gifts to
her kindred (which always places her more or
less under authority), but she was the owner of
the tent and the household property, and thus
enjoyed the liberty which ownership always entails.
This explains how she was able to free herself at
pleasure from her husband, who was really nothing
but a temporary lover. Ibn Batua, even in the
fourteenth century found that the women of Zebid
were perfectly ready to marry strangers. The
husband might depart when he pleased, but his
wife in that case could never be induced to follow
him. She bade him a friendly adieu and took upon
herself the whole charge of any children of the
marriage. The women in J&acirc;hil&icirc;ya had the right to
dismiss their husbands, and the form of dismissal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>was this: &#8220;If they lived in a tent they turned it
round, so that if the door faced east it now faced
west, and when the man saw this, he knew he was
dismissed and did not enter.&#8221; The tent belonged
to the woman: the husband was received there,
and at her good pleasure. We find many cases of
<i>beena</i> marriage among widely different peoples.
Frazer<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> cites an interesting example among the
tribes on the north frontier of Abyssinia, partially
Semitic peoples, not yet under the influence of
Islam, who preserve a maternal marriage closely
resembling the <i>beena</i> form, but have as well a
purchase marriage, by which a wife is acquired by
the payment of a bride-price and becomes the
property of her husband.</p>

<p>A very curious form of conjugal contract is recorded
among the Hassanyeh Arabs of the White
Nile, where the wife passed by contract for a portion
of her time only under the authority of her husband.
It illustrates in a striking way the conflict in marriage
between the old rights of the woman and the rising
power of the husband.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;When the parents of the man and the woman
meet to settle the price of the woman, the price
depends on how many days in the week the marriage
tie is to be strictly observed. The woman&#8217;s mother
first of all proposes that, taking everything into
consideration, with due regard to the feelings of the
family, she could not think of binding her daughter
to a due observance of that chastity which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>matrimony is expected to command for more than two
days in the week. After a great deal of apparently
angry discussion, and the promise on the part of the
relations of the man to pay more, it is arranged that
the marriage shall hold good, as is customary among
the first families of the tribe, for four days in the
week, viz. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday, and in compliance with old established
custom, the marriage rites during the three remaining
days shall not be insisted on, during which days
the bride shall be perfectly free to act as she may
think proper, either by adhering to her husband and
home, or by enjoying her freedom and independence
from all observance of matrimonial obligations.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p></div>

<p>A further striking example of mother-right is
furnished by the Mariana Islands, where the position
of women was distinctly superior.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Even when the man had contributed an equal
share of property on marriage, the wife dictated
everything, and the man could undertake nothing
without her approval; but if the woman committed
an offence, the man was held responsible and suffered
the punishment. The women could speak in the
assembly; they held property, and if a woman asked
anything of a man, he gave it up without a murmur.
If a wife was unfaithful, the husband could send her
home, keep her property, and kill the adulterer; but
if the man was guilty or even suspected of the same
offence, the women of the neighbourhood destroyed
his house and all his visible property, and the owner
was fortunate if he escaped with a whole skin; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>if the wife was not pleased with her husband, she
withdrew, and a similar attack followed. On this
account many men were not married, preferring to
live with paid women.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p></div>

<p>A similar case of the rebellion of men against their
position is recorded in Guinea, where religious
symbolism was used by the husband as a way of
obtaining control and possession of his wife. The
maternal system held with respect only to the chief
wife.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;It was customary, however, for a man to buy
and take to wife a slave, a friendless person with
whom he could deal at pleasure, who had no kindred
who could interfere with her, and to consecrate her
to his Bossum, or god. The Bossum wife, slave
as she had been, ranked next to the chief wife, and
was exceptionally treated. She alone was very
jealously guarded, she alone was sacrificed at her
husband&#8217;s death. She was, in fact, wife in a peculiar
sense. And having by consecration been made of
the kindred and worship of her husband her children
could be born of his kindred and worship.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p></div>

<p>It will be readily seen that the special rights held
by the husband over these captive-wives would
come to be greatly desired. But the capture of
women was always difficult, as it frequently led to
quarrels and even warfare with the woman&#8217;s tribe,
and for this reason was never widely practised.
It would therefore be necessary for another way of
escape from the bonds of the maternal marriage
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>to be found. This was done by a system of buying
the wife from her clan-kindred, in which case she
became the property of her husband.</p>

<p>The change did not, of course, take place at once,
and we have many examples of a transition period
where the old customs are in conflict with the new.
Both forms of marriage, the maternal and the purchase
contract, are practised side by side by many
peoples. These cases are so instructive that I must
add one or two examples to those already noticed.
The <i>ambel-anak</i> marriage of Sumatra is the maternal
form, but there is another marriage known as <i>djudur</i>,
by which a man buys his wife as his absolute property.
There is a complicated system of payments,
on which the husband&#8217;s rights to take the wife to
his home depends. If the final sum is paid (but
this is not commonly claimed except in the case of
a quarrel between the families) the woman becomes
to all intents and purposes the slave of the man;
but if, on the other hand, as is not at all uncommon,
the husband fails or has difficulty in making the
main payment, he becomes the debtor of his wife&#8217;s
family, and he is practically the slave, all his labour
being due to his wife&#8217;s family without any reduction
in the debt, which must be paid in full, before he
regains his liberty.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> In Ceylon, again, there are
two forms of marriage, called <i>beena</i> and <i>deega</i>,
which cause a marked difference in the position of
the wife. A woman married under the <i>beena</i> form
lives in the house or immediate neighbourhood of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>her parents, and if so married she has the right of
inheritance along with her brothers; but if married
in <i>deega</i> she goes to live in her husband&#8217;s house and
village and loses her rights in her own family.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>In Africa where the <i>beena maternal marriage</i> is
usual, and the husband serves for his wife and lives
with her family, it is said that families are usually
more or less willing <i>for value received</i> to give a woman
to a man to take away with him, or to let him have
his <i>beena</i> wife to transfer to his own house. Among
the Wayao and Mang&#8217;anja of the Shirehighlands,
south of Lake Nyassa, a man on marrying leaves his
own village and goes to live in that of his wife;
but, as an alternative, he is allowed to pay a bride-price,
in which case he takes his wife away to his
home.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> Again among the Banyai on the Zambesi,
if the husband gives nothing the children of the
marriage belong to the wife&#8217;s family, but if he gives
so many cattle to his wife&#8217;s parents the children are
his.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Similar cases may be found elsewhere. In the
Watubela Islands between New Guinea and Celebes a
man may either pay for his wife before marriage, or
he may, without paying, live as her husband in her
parents&#8217; house, working for her. In the former case,
the children belong to him, in the latter to the
mother&#8217;s family, but he may buy them subsequently
at a price.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> Campbell records of the Limboo tribe
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>(where the bride is usually purchased and lives with
the husband), that if poverty compels the bridegroom
to serve for his wife, he becomes the slave
of her father, &#8220;until by his work he has redeemed
his bride.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> An interesting case occurs in some
Californian tribes where the husband has to live
with the wife and work, until he has paid to her
kindred the full price for her and her child. So
far has custom advanced in favour of father-right
that the children of a wife not paid for are regarded
as bastards and held in contempt.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>Wherever we find the payment of a bride-price,
in whatever form, there is sure indication of the
decay of mother-right: woman has become property.
Among the Bassa Komo of Nigeria marriage is
usually effected by an exchange of sisters or other
female relatives. The men may marry as many
wives as they have women to give to other men.
In this tribe the women look after the children,
but the boys, when four years old, go to live and
work with the fathers.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> The husbands of the
Bambala tribe (inhabiting the Congo states between
the rivers Inzia and Kwilu) have to abstain from
visiting their wives for a year after the birth of each
child, but they are allowed to return to her on the
payment to her father of two goats.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Among
the Bassanga on the south-west of Lake Moeru the
children of the wife belong to the mother&#8217;s kin,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>but the children of slaves are the property of the
father.</p>

<p>The right of a father to his children was established
only by contract. Even where the wife had
been given up by her kindred and allowed to live
with her husband, we find that the children may be
claimed by her family. Thus among the Makolo
the price paid on marriage might merely cover the
right to have the wife, and in this case the children
belonged to the wife&#8217;s family. It might, however,
cover a certain right to the children if that had been
contracted for, but never such a right as separated
them wholly from the mother&#8217;s family. To effect
this it was necessary that a further price should be
paid at the father&#8217;s death. This sum once paid,
her family had &#8220;given her up&#8221; and her children
were entirely severed from them.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> The legal
acknowledgment of fatherhood in all cases had to
be paid for.</p>

<p>There are many customs pointing to this new
father-force asserting itself, and pushing aside the
mother-power. In Africa, among the Bavili the
mother has the right to pawn her child, but she
must first consult the father, so that he may have a
chance of giving her goods to save the pledging.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
This is very plainly a step towards father-right.
There is no distinction between legitimate and
illegitimate children. Similar conditions prevail
among the Alladians of the Ivory Coast, but here
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>the mother cannot pledge her children without the
consent of her brother or other male head of
the family. The father has the right to ransom the
child.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> An even stronger example of the property
value of children is furnished by the custom found
among many tribes, by which the father has to
make a present to the wife&#8217;s family when a child
dies: this is called &#8220;buying the child.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> A similar
custom prevails among the Maori people of New
Zealand; when a child dies, or even meets with an
accident, the mother&#8217;s relations, headed by her
brothers, turn out in force against the father. He
must defend himself until wounded. Blood once
drawn, the combat ceases; but the attacking party
plunders his house and appropriates the husband&#8217;s
property, and finally sits down to a feast provided
by him.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>These cases, with the inferences they suggest,
show that the power a husband and father possessed
over his wife and her children was gained through
purchase. And it is not the fact of the husband&#8217;s
power, however great it might be, that is so important,
but the fact that by the change in the form of
marriage the wife and her children were cut off
from the woman&#8217;s clan-kindred, whose duty to
protect them was now withdrawn. Here, then,
was the reason of the change from mother-right to
father-right. The monopolist desire of the husband
to possess for himself the woman and her children
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>(perhaps the deepest rooted of all the instincts)
reasserted itself. But the regaining of this individual
possession by man was due, not to male strength,
but to purchase. I must insist upon this. As soon
as women became sexually marketable their freedom
was doomed.</p>

<p>There are many interesting cases of transition in
which the children belong sometimes to the mother
and sometimes to the father. Again I can give one
or two examples only. In the island of Mangia
the parents at the birth of the child arranged
between themselves whether it should be dedicated
to the father&#8217;s god or to the mother&#8217;s. The dedication
took place forthwith, and finally determined
which parent had the ownership of the child.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
Among the Haidis, children belong to the clan of
the mother, but in exceptional cases when the clan
of the father is reduced in numbers, the new-born
child may be given to the father&#8217;s sister to suckle.
It is then spoken of as belonging to the paternal
aunt and is counted to its father&#8217;s clan.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> It is also
possible to transfer a child to the father by giving
it one of the names common to his clan. There
are many curious customs practised by certain
tribes, wavering between mother and father descent.
In Samoa religion decides the question. At the
birth of a child the totem of each parent is prayed
to in turn (usually, though not always, starting with
that of the father) and whichever totem happens
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>to be invoked at the moment of birth is the child&#8217;s
totem for life and decides whether he or she belongs
to the clan of the mother or the father.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Equally
curious was the custom of the Liburni, where the
children were all brought up together until they
were five years old. They were then collected and
examined in order to trace their likeness to the
men and they were assigned to their fathers accordingly.
Whoever received a boy from his mother
in this way regarded him as his son.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Similarly
with the Arabs, where one woman was the wife of
several men, the custom was either for the woman
to decide to which of them the child was to belong,
or the child was assigned by an expert to one of
the joint husbands to be regarded as his own.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>These facts throw a strong light on the bond
between the father and the child, which was a legal
bond, not dependent, as it is with us, upon blood
relationship. Fatherhood really arose out of the
ownership of purchase. And for this reason the
father&#8217;s right came to extend to all the children of
the wife. It does not appear that the husband makes
any distinction between his wife&#8217;s children, even if
they were begotten by other men. Chastity is not
regarded as a virtue, and in those cases where
unfaithfulness in a wife is punished, it is always
because the woman, who has passed from the protection
of her kindred, acts without her husband&#8217;s
permission. Interchange of wives is common,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>while it is one of the duties of hospitality to offer
a wife to a stranger guest. Husbands sometimes,
indeed, seek other men for their wives, believing
they will obtain sons who will excel all others.
Thus of the Arabs we are told, there is one form of
marriage according to which a man says to his
wife, &#8220;Send a message to such a one and beg him
to have intercourse with you.&#8221; The husband acts
in this way in order that his offspring may be noble.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
When a Hindu marries, all the children previously
born from his wife become his own; in Pakpatan,
even when a woman has forsaken her husband for
ten years, the children she brings forth are divided
between her and her lover.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Similarly in Madagascar,
when a woman is divorced, any children she
afterwards bears belong to her husband.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> Campbell
tells us of children born out of wedlock in the
Limboo tribe that the father may obtain possession
of the boys by purchase and by naming them, but
the girls belong to the mother.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>I am very certain that it was through property
considerations and for no moral causes that the
stringency of the moral code was tightened for
women. It seems to me of very great importance
that women should grasp firmly this truth: the
virtue of chastity owes its origin to property. Our
minds fall so readily under the spell of such ideas
as chastity and purity. There is a mass of real
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>superstition on this question&mdash;a belief in a kind of
magic in chastity. But, indeed, continence had at
first no connection with morals. The sense of ownership
has been the seed-plot of our moral code. To it
we are indebted for the first germs of the sexual inhibitions
which, sanctified, by religion and supported
by custom, have, under the unreasoned idealism of
the common mind, filled life with cruelties and
jealous exclusions, with suicides, and murders, and
secret shames.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>This brings me to summarise the point we have
reached. Father-right was dependent on purchase-possession
and had nothing to do with actual fatherhood.
The payment of a bride-price, the giving
of a sister in exchange, as also marriage with a slave,
gained for the husband the control over his wife
and ownership of the children. I could bring
forward much more evidence in proof of this fact
that property, and not kinship, was the basis of
fatherhood, did the limits of my space allow me
to do so; such cases are common in all parts of
the world where the transitional stage has been
reached. The maternal clan, with its strong social
cohesion is then broken up by the growing power
of individual interests pushing aside the old customs,
and bringing about the restoration of the family.
I believe that the causes by which the father gained
his position as the dominant partner in marriage
must be clear to every one from the examples I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>have given. Fatherhood established in the first
stage of the family on jealous authority, now, after
a period of more or less complete obscuration, rises
again as the dominant force in marriage. The
father has bought back his position as patriarch.
On the other hand the mother has lost her freedom
that came with the protection of her kindred,
under the social organisation of the clan. Looking
back through the lengthening record, we find that
another step has been taken in the history of the
family. This time is it a step forward, or a step
backward? This is a question I shall not try to
answer, for, indeed, I am not sure.</p>

<p>Yet in case I am mistaken here, let me say at
once I am certain that this return to the restricted
family was a necessary and inevitable step. The
individual forces had to triumph. This may seem
a contradiction to all I have just said. What I
wish to show is this: one and all the phases in the
development of society have been needful and
fruitful as successive stages in growth; yet none
can continue&mdash;none be regarded as the final stage,
for each becomes insufficient and narrow from the
standpoint of the needs of a later stage. We have
reached the third stage&mdash;the patriarchal family
which still endures. And last and hardest to
eradicate is that monopoly of sexual possession,
which says: &#8220;This woman and her children are mine:
I have tabooed her for life.&#8221; Mankind has still to
outlive this brute instinct in its upward way to
civilisation.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></h2>

<h3>WOMEN AND PRIMITIVE INDUSTRY</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> referred in an earlier chapter to a letter
from Mr. H.&nbsp;G. Wells, sent to me after the publication
of my book, <i>The Truth about Woman</i>. Now,
there is one sentence in this letter that I wish to
quote here, because it brings home just what it
is my purpose in this chapter to show&mdash;that the
mother-age was a civilisation owing its institutions,
and its early victories over nature, rather to the
genius of woman than to that of man. Mr. Wells
does not, indeed, say this. He rejects the mother-age,
and in questioning my acceptance of it as a
stage in the past histories of societies, he writes:
&#8220;The primitive matriarchate never was anything
more than mother at the washing-tub and father
looking miserable.&#8221;</p>

<p>It seems to me that here, in his own inimitable way,
Mr. Wells (though I think quite unconsciously) sums
up the past labour-history of woman and man.
His statement has very far-reaching considerations.
It forces us to accept the active utility of primitive
woman in the community&mdash;a utility more developed
and practical than that of man. This
was really the basis of women&#8217;s position of power.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
The constructive quality of the female mind, at a
time when the male attention and energy were
fixed chiefly on the destructive activities of warfare,
was liberated for use and invention. Women were
the seekers, slowly increasing their efficiency.</p>

<p>Very much the same account of the primitive
sexual division in work was given by an Australian
Kurnai to Messrs. Fison and Howitt, in a sentence
that has been quoted very frequently: &#8220;A man
hunts, spears fish, fights and sits about, all the rest
is woman&#8217;s work.&#8221; This may be accepted as a fair
statement of how work is divided between the two
sexes among primitive peoples. Now, what I
wish to make plain is that it was an arrangement in
which the advantage was really on the side of the
woman rather than on that of the man. I would
refer the reader back to what has been said on this
subject in Chapter III, where I summed up the
conditions acting on the women in the hypothetical
first stage of the primordial family. We saw that
the males were chiefly concerned with the absorbing
duties of sex and fighting rivals, and also hunting
for game. The women&#8217;s interest, on the other
hand, was bent on domestic activities&mdash;in caring
for their children and developing the food supplies
immediately around them. From the hearth-home,
or shelter, as the start of settled life, and with
their intelligence sharpened by the keen chisel of
necessity, women carried on their work as the
organisers and directors of industrial occupations.
Very slowly did they make each far-reaching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
discovery; seeds cast into the ground sprouted and
gave the first start of agriculture. The plant world
gave women the best returns for the efforts they
made, and they began to store up food. Contrivance
followed contrivance, each one making it possible
for women to do more. Certain animals, possibly
brought back by the hunters from the forests, were
kept and tamed. Presently the use of fire was
discovered&mdash;we know not how&mdash;but women became
the guardians of this source of life. And now,
instead of caves or tree-shelters, there were huts
and tents and houses, and of these, too, women
were frequently the builders. The home from the
first was of greater importance to the women; it
was the place where the errant males rejoined their
wives and children, and hence the women became
the owners of the homes and the heads of households.
For as yet the men were occupied in fighting.
The clumsy and the stupid among them were
killed soonest; the fine hand, the quick eye&mdash;these
prevailed age by age. Tools and weapons were
doubtless fashioned by these fighters, but for
destruction; the male&#8217;s attention was directed
mainly by his own desires. And may we not
accept that among the most pressing activities of
women was the need to tame man and make him
social, so that he could endure the rights of others
than himself?</p>

<p>So through the long generations the life of human
societies continued. Those activities, due to female
influence, developing and opening up new ways in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
all directions, until we have that early civilisation,
which I have called the mother-age.</p>

<p>All the world over, even to this day, this separation
in the labour activities of the two sexes can be
traced. Destructive work, demanding a special
development of strength, with corresponding periods
of rest, falls to men; and contrasted with this violent
and intermittent male force we find, with the same
uniformity, that the work of women is domestic
and constructive, being connected with the care
of children and all the various industries which
radiate from the home&mdash;work demanding a different
kind of strength, more enduring, more continuous,
but at a lower tension.</p>

<p>Bonwick&#8217;s account of the work of Tasmanian
women may be taken as typical&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;In addition to the necessary duty of looking
after the children, the women had to provide all
the food for the household excepting that derived
from the chase of the kangaroo. They climbed
up hills for the opossum&#8221; (a very difficult task, requiring
great strength and also skill), &#8220;delved in the
ground for yams, native bread, and nutritious roots,
groped about the rocks for shellfish, dived beneath
the sea for oysters, and fished for the finny tribe.
In addition to this, they carried, on their frequent
tramps, the household stuffs in native baskets of
their own manufacture.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p></div>

<p>Among the Indians of Guiana the men&#8217;s work is
to hunt, and to cut down the trees when the cassava
is to be planted. When the men have felled the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>trees and cleaned the ground, the women plant the
cassava and undertake all the subsequent operations;
agriculture is entirely in their hands. They are
little, if at all, weaker than the men, and they work
all day while the men are often in their hammocks
smoking; but there is no cruelty or oppression
exercised by the men towards the women.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>In Africa we meet with much the same conditions
of labour. &#8220;The work is done chiefly by the
women, this is universal; they hoe the fields, sow
the seed, and reap the harvest. To them, too, falls
all the labour of house-building, grinding corn,
brewing beer, cooking, washing, and caring for
almost all the material interests of the community.
The men tend the cattle, hunt, go to war; they
also spend much time sitting in council over the
conduct of affairs.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>I may note the interesting account of Prof.
Haddon<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> of the work of the Western Tribes of the
Torres Straits&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The men fished, fought, built houses, did a little
gardening, made fish-lines, fish-hooks, spears, and
other implements, constructed dance-masks and
head-dresses, and all the paraphernalia for the
various ceremonies and dances. They performed
all the rites and dances, and in addition did a good
deal of strutting up and down, loafing and &#8216;yarning.&#8217;
The women cooked and prepared the food, did most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>of the gardening, collected shell-fish, and speared
fish on the reefs, made petticoats, baskets and mats.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Similar examples might be almost indefinitely
multiplied. Among the Andamanese, while the
men go into the jungle to hunt pigs, the women
fetch drinking water and firewood, catch shell-fish,
make fishing nets and baskets, spin thread, and
cook the food ready for the return of the men.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
The Moki women of America have fifty ways of
preparing corn for food. They make all the preparations
necessary for these varied dishes, involving
the arts of the stonecutter, the carrier, the mason,
the miller and the cook.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> In New Caledonia &#8220;girls
work in the plantations, boys learn to fight.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>We should, however, fall into a popular error
concerning the division of labour in savagery, if
we consider that all women&#8217;s work is regarded as
degrading to men and all men&#8217;s work is tabooed
to women. The duties of war and the chase are
the chief occupation of men, yet in all parts of the
world women have fought at need, and sometimes
habitually, both to assist their men and also against
them. Thus Buckley, who lived for many years
among the Australian tribes, relates that when the
tribe he lived with was attacked by a hostile party,
the men &#8220;raised a war-cry; on hearing this the
women threw off their rugs and, each armed with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>a short club, flew to the assistance of their husbands
and brothers.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> In Central Australia the men
occasionally beat the women through jealousy, but
on such occasions it is by no means rare for the
women, single handed, to beat the men severely.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
Again, men carry on, as a rule, the negotiations on
tribal concerns, but in such matters exceptions are
very numerous. Among the Australian Dieyerie,
Curr states that the women act as ambassadors to
arrange treaties, and invariably succeed in their
mission.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> The same conditions are found among
the American Indians. Men are the hunters and
fishers, but women also hunt and fish. Among the
Yahgan of Tierra del Fuego fishing is left entirely
to the women,<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> and this is not at all unusual.
Mrs. Allison states of the Similkameen Indians of
British Columbia that formerly &#8220;the women were
nearly as good hunters as the men,&#8221; but being
sensitive to the ridicule of the white settlers, they
have given up hunting.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> In hunting trips, the help
of women is often not to be despised. Warburton
Pike writes thus: &#8220;I saw what an advantage it is
to take women on a hunting trip. If we killed
anything, we had only to cut up and <i>cache</i> the
meat, and the women would carry it. On returning
to camp we could throw ourselves down on a pile
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>of caribou skins and smoke our pipes in comfort,
but the women&#8217;s work was never finished.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> This
account is very suggestive. The man undergoes
the fatigue of hunting, and when he has thrown
the game at the woman&#8217;s feet his part is done; it
is her duty to carry it and to cook it, as well as to
make the vessels in which the food is placed. The
skins and the refuse are hers to utilise, and all the
industries connected with clothing are chiefly in her
hands.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Hearne, in his delightful old narrative,
speaks of the assistance of women on hunting
expeditions&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;For when all the men are heavy laden they can
neither hunt nor travel to any considerable distance;
and in case they meet with any success in hunting,
who is to carry the produce of their labour?&#8221;</p></div>

<p>He adds with a charming frankness&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Women were made for labour; one of them can
carry or haul as much as two men can do. They
also pitch our tents, make and mend our clothing,
keep us warm at night, and, in fact, there is no
such thing as travelling any considerable distance,
or any length of time, in this country without their
assistance.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p></div>

<p>Numerous other examples might be added which
illustrate how women take part in the destructive
work of men; conversely we find not a few cases of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>the co-operation of men in the women&#8217;s activities.
The world over, women are usually the weavers
and spinners; but with the Navajo and in some of
the Pueblos the men are among the best weavers.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
Among the Indians of Guiana the men are specially
skilful in basket-weaving, and here also they as
well as the women spin and weave.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> More curious
is the custom in East Africa where all the sewing
for their own and the women&#8217;s garments is done by
the men, and very well done. Sewing is here so
entirely recognised as men&#8217;s work that a wife may
obtain a divorce if she &#8220;can show a neglected rend
in her petticoat.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>It is a common mistake, arising from insufficient
knowledge, to suppose that savage women are
specially subject to oppression. Their life is hard
as we look at it, but not as they look at it. We
have still much to learn on these matters. An even
greater error is the view that these women are a
source of weakness to the male members of their
families. The very reverse is the truth. Primitive
women are strong in body and capable in work.
Fison and Howitt, in discussing this question, state
of the Australian women, &#8220;In times of peace, they
are the hardest workers and the most useful members
of the community.&#8221; And in times of war, &#8220;they
are perfectly capable of taking care of themselves
at all times, and so far from being an encumbrance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>on the warriors, they will fight, if need be, as bravely
as the men, and with even greater ferocity.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> This
is no exceptional case. The strength of savage
women is proved by reports from widely different
races, of which all testify to their physical capability
and aptness for labour. Schellong,<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> who has carefully
studied the Papuans of the German protectorate
of New Guinea, from the anthropological point of
view, &#8220;considers that the women are more strongly
built than the men.&#8221; Nor does heavy work appear
to damage the health or beauty of the women,
but the contrary. Thus among the Andombies on
the Congo, to give one instance, the women, though
working very hard as carriers, and as labourers in
general, lead an entirely happy existence; they
are often stronger than the men and more finely
developed: some of them, we are told, have really
splendid figures. And Parke, speaking of the
Manyuema of the Arruwimi in the same region,
says that &#8220;they are fine animals, and the women
very handsome; they carry loads as heavy as
those of the men and do it quite as well.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
Again, McGee<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> comments on the extraordinary
capacity of quite aged women for heavy labour.
He tells of &#8220;a withered crone, weighing apparently
not more than 80 to 90 lb. who carried a <i>kilio</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>containing a stone mortar 196 lb. in weight for
more than half a mile on a sandy road without
any perceptible exhaustion. The proportion of the
active aged is much larger than among civilised
people.&#8221;</p>

<p>I may pause to note some of the numerous
industries of which women were the originators.
First of all, woman is the food-giver; all the
labours relating to the preparation of food, and to
the utilisation of the side products of foodstuffs
are usually found in the hands of women. Women
are everywhere the primitive agriculturists. They
beat out the seeds from plants; dig for roots and
tubers, strain the poisonous juices from the cassava
and make bread from the residue; and it was under
their attention that a southern grass was first
developed into what we know as Indian corn.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
The removal of poisonous matter from tapioca by
means of hot water is also the discovery of savage
women.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> All the evolution of primitive agriculture
may be traced to women&#8217;s industry. Power tells
of the Yokia women in Central California who
employ neither plough nor hoe, but cultivate the
ground by digging the earth deep and rubbing it
fine with their hands, and by this means they get
an excellent yield.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Women have everywhere been
the first potters; vessels were needed for use in
cooking, to carry and to hold water, and to store
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>the supplies of food. For the same reason baskets
were woven. Women invented and exercised in
common multifarious household occupations and
industries. Curing food, tanning the hides of
animals, spinning, weaving, dyeing&mdash;all are carried
on by women. The domestication of animals is
usually in women&#8217;s hands. They are also the
primitive architects; the hut, in widely different
parts of the world&mdash;among Kaffirs, Fuegians,
Polynesians, Kamtschatdals&mdash;is built by women.
We have seen that the communal houses of the
American Indians are mainly erected by the women.
Women were frequently, though not always, the
primitive doctors. Among the Kurds, for instance,
all the medical knowledge is in the hands of the
women, who are the hereditary <i>hakims</i>.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> Women
seem to have prepared the first intoxicating liquors.
The Quissama women in Angola climb the gigantic
palm trees to obtain palm-beer.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> In the ancient
legends of the North, women are clearly represented
as the discoverers of ale.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>It would be easy to go on almost indefinitely
multiplying examples of the industries of primitive
women. There can be no doubt at all that their
work is exacting and incessant; it is also inventive
in its variety and its ready application to the
practical needs of life. If a catalogue of the primitive
forms of labour were made, each woman would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>be found doing at least half-a-dozen things while a
man did one. We may accept the statement of
Prof. Mason that in the early history of mankind
&#8220;women were the industrial, elaborative, conservative
half of society. All the peaceful arts of
to-day were once women&#8217;s peculiar province. Along
the lines of industrialism she was pioneer, inventor,
author, originator.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>There is another matter that must be noted. The
primitive division of labour between the sexes was
not in any sense an arrangement dictated by men,
nor did they impose the women&#8217;s tasks upon them.
The view that the women are forced to work by the
laziness of the men, and that their heavy and
incessant labour is a proof of their degraded position
is entirely out of focus. Quite the reverse is the
truth. Evidence is not wanting of the great advantage
arising to women from their close connection
with labour. It was largely their control over the
food supply and their position as actual producers
which gave them so much influence, and even
authority in the mother-age. In this connection I
may quote the statement of Miss Werner about the
African women as representing the true conditions&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;I cannot say that, so far as my own observations
went, the women&#8217;s lot seemed to be a specially hard
one. In fact, they are too important an element
in the community not to be treated with consideration.
The fact that they do most of the heavy
field-work does not imply that they are a down-trodden
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>sex. On the contrary, it gives them a
considerable pull, as a man will think twice before
endangering his food supply.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p></div>

<p>Mr. Horatio Hale, a well-known American anthropologist
likewise observes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The common opinion that women among savage
tribes in general are treated with harshness, and
regarded as slaves, or at least as inferiors, is, like
many common opinions, based on error, originating
in too large and indiscriminate deduction from
narrow premises.... The wife of a Samoan landowner
or Navajo shepherd has no occasion, so far
as her position in her family or among her people,
to envy the wife of a German peasant.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p></div>

<p>Certainly savage women do not count their work
as any degradation. There is really an equal
division of labour between the sexes, though the
work of the men is accomplished more fitfully than
that of the women. The militant activities of
fighting and hunting are essential in primitive life.
The women know this, and they do their share&mdash;the
industrial share, willingly, without question,
and without compulsion. It is entirely absurd in
this work-connection to regard men as the oppressors
of women. Rather the advantage is on
the women&#8217;s side. For one thing, just because
they are accustomed to hard labour all their lives,
they are little, if any, weaker than men. Primitive
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>women are strong in body, and capable in work.
The powers they enjoy as well as their manifold
activities are the result of their position as mothers,
this function being to them a source of strength and
not a plea of weakness.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;They who are accustomed to the ways of
civilised women only,&#8221; remarks Mr. Fison, &#8220;can
hardly believe what savage women are capable of,
even when they may well be supposed to be at their
weakest. For instance, an Australian tribe on the
march scarcely take the trouble to halt for so
slight a performance as childbirth. The newly
born infant is wrapped in skins, the march is resumed,
and the mother trudges on with the rest.
Moreover, as is well known, among many tribes
elsewhere it is the father who is put to bed, while
the mother goes about her work as if nothing had
happened.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p></div>

<p>Another important advantage arising to women,
through their identification with the early industrial
process, was their position as the first property
owners. They were almost the sole creators of
ownership in land, and held in this respect a position
of great power. This explains the fact that in the
transactions of the North American tribes with the
Colonial Government many deeds of assignment bear
female signatures.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> A form of divorce used by a
husband in ancient Arabia was: &#8220;Begone, for I
will no longer drive thy flocks to pasture.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> In
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>almost all cases the household goods belonged to
the woman. The stores of roots and berries laid
up for a time of scarcity were the property of the
wife, and the husband would not touch them
without her permission. In many cases such
property was very extensive. Among the Menomini
Indians, for instance, a woman of good circumstances
would own as many as 1200 to 1500
birch-bark vessels.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> In the New Mexico Pueblos
what comes from the outside of the house as soon
as it is inside is put under the immediate control of
the women. Bandelier, in his report of his tour
in Mexico, tells us that &#8220;his host at Cochiti, New
Mexico, could not sell an ear of corn or a string of
chili without the consent of his fourteen-year-old
daughter, Ignacia, who kept house for her widowed
father.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>I must now bring this brief chapter to a close.
But first I would give one further example. It is
an account of the Pelew matrons&#8217; work in the taro
fields. Here the richest and most influential women
count it their privilege to labour, and it will be remembered
that these women are called &#8220;mothers
of the land.&#8221; They are politically and socially
superior to the men; and their position is dependent
largely on their close connection with the staple
industry of the island.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The richest woman in the village looks with
pride on her taro patch, and although she has
female followers enough to allow her merely to
superintend the work without taking part in it,
she nevertheless prefers to lay aside her fine apron,
and to betake herself to the field, merely clad in a
small apron that barely hides her nakedness, with
a little mat on her back to protect her from the
burning heat of the sun, and with a shade of banana
leaves for her eyes. There, dripping with sweat
in the burning sun, and coated with mud to the
hips and over the elbows, she toils to set the younger
women a good example. Moreover, as in every
other occupation, the <i>Kalitho</i>, the gods must be
invoked, and who could be better fitted for the
discharge of so important a duty than &#8216;the Mother
of the House.&#8217;&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Here is a picture of labour that may well make
women pause to think.</p>

<h3>TRACES OF MOTHER-RIGHT CUSTOMS IN ANCIENT AND<br />
MODERN CIVILISATIONS</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">I propose</span> in this chapter to examine, as fully as
I can, the traces that mother-right customs have
left among some of the great races of antiquity, as
also in the early records of western civilisations.
It is the more necessary to do this because there is
so marked a tendency to minimise the importance
of the mother-age, and to regard the patriarchal
family as primeval and universal. So much interesting
material is available, and so wide a field
of inquiry must be covered, that I shall be able to
give a mere outline sketch, for the purpose of suggesting,
rather than proving, the widespread prevalence
of the communal clan and the maternal
family.</p>

<p>As to whether this maternal-stage, with kinship
and inheritance passing through the mother, has
everywhere preceded the second patriarchal period,
it is difficult to be at all certain. Dr. Westermarck,
Mr. Crawley and others have argued against this
view. But (as I have before had occasion to point
out) their chief motive has been to discredit the
theory of promiscuity, with which mother-descent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
has been so commonly, and so mistakenly, connected.
It does not seem to have been held as
possible that the mother-age was a much later
development, whose social customs were made for
the regulation of the family relationships. A number
of very primitive races exhibit no traces, that
have yet been discovered, of such a system, and
have descent in the male line. This has been
thought to be a further proof against a maternal
stage. But here again is an error; we are not
entitled to regard mother-descent as necessarily the
primitive custom. I believe and have tried to show,
from the examples of the Australian tribes and
elsewhere, that in many cases the stage of the
maternal clan has not been reached. If I am right
here, we have the way cleared from much confusion.
I would suggest, as also possible, that there may
among some people, have been retrogressions, customs
and habits found out as beneficial, and perhaps for
long practised, have by some tribes been forgotten.
There can be no hard and fast rule of progress for any
race. The whole subject is thorny and obscure, and
the evidence on the question is often contradictory.
Still I hold the claim I make is not without foundation.
I have tried to show how the causes which
led to the maternal system were perfectly simple
and natural causes, arising out of needs that must
have operated universally in the past history of
mankind. And this indicates a maternal stage at
some period for all branches of the human family.
Again the widespread prevalence of mother-right<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
survivals among races where the patriarchal system
has been for long firmly established lends support
to such a view, which will be strengthened by the
evidence now to be brought forward. It will be
necessary to go step by step, from one race to
another, and to many different countries, and I
would ask my readers not to shrink from the trouble
of following me.</p>

<p>Let us turn first to ancient Egypt, where women
held a position more free and more honourable than
they have in any country to-day.</p>

<p>Herodotus, who was a keen observer, records his
astonishment at this freedom, and writes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;They have established laws and customs opposite
for the most part to those of the rest of
mankind.... With them women go to market
and traffic; men stay at home and weave.... The
men carry burdens on their heads; the women on
their shoulders.... The boys are never forced to
maintain their parents unless they wish to do so;
the girls are obliged to, even if they do not wish
it.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p></div>

<p>From this last rule it is logical to infer that women
inherited property, as is to-day the case among the
Beni-Amer of Africa,<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> where daughters have to
provide for their parents.</p>

<p>Diodorus goes further than Herodotus: he affirms
that in the Egyptian family it is the man who is
subjected to the woman.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;All this explains why the queen receives more
power and respect than the king, and why, among
private individuals, the woman rules over the man,
and that it is stipulated between married couples,
by the terms of the dowry-contract, that the man
shall obey the woman.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p></div>

<p>There is probably some exaggeration in this
account, nevertheless, the demotic deeds, in a
measure, confirm it. By the law of maternal
inheritance, an Egyptian wife was often richer
than her husband, and enjoyed the dignity and
freedom always involved by the possession of
property. More than three thousand three hundred
years ago men and women were recognised as equal
in this land.</p>

<p>Under such privileges the wife was entirely
preserved from any subjection; she was able to
dictate the terms of the marriage. She held the
right of making contracts without authorisation;
she remained absolute mistress of her dowry. The
marriage-contract also specified the sums that the
husband was to pay to his wife, either as a nuptial
gift or annual pension, or as compensation in case
of divorce. In some cases the whole property of
the husband was made over to the wife, and when
this was done, it was stipulated that she should
provide for him during his life, and discharge the
expenses of his burial and tomb.</p>

<p>These unusual proprietary rights of the Egyptian
wife can be explained only as being traceable to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>an early period of mother-right. Without proof of
any absolutely precise text, we have an accumulation
of facts that render it probable that, at one time,
descent was traced through the mother. It is
significant that the word <i>husband</i> never occurs in
the marriage deeds before the reign of Philometor.
This ruler (it would appear in order to establish the
position of the father in the family) decreed that
all transfers of property made by the wife should
henceforth be authorised by the husband. Up to
this time public deeds often mention only the mother,
but King Philometor ordered the names of contractors
to be registered according to the paternal
line. Besides this, the hieroglyphic funeral inscriptions
frequently bear the name of the mother, without
indicating that of the father.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>All these facts attest that women in Egypt
enjoyed an exceptionally favourable position. We
may compare this position with that held by the
Touareg women of the Sahara, who, through the
custom of maternal inheritance, for long continued,
have in their hands the strong power of wealth, and
thus exercise extraordinary authority, giving rise to
what I have called &#8220;a pecuniary matriarchy.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is probable that in Egypt property was originally
entirely in the hands of women, as is usual
under the matriarchal system. Later, a tradition
in favour of the old privileges would seem to have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>persisted after descent was changed from the
maternal to the paternal line. The marriage-contracts
may thus be regarded as enforcing by
agreement what would occur naturally under the
maternal customs. The husband&#8217;s property was
made over by deed to the wife (at first entirely,
and afterwards in part) to secure its inheritance by
the children of the marriage. It was in such wise
way the Egyptians arranged the difficult problem
of the fusing of mother-right with father-right.</p>

<p>In the very ancient civilisation of Babylon we
find women in a position of honour, with privileges
similar in many ways to those they enjoyed in
Egypt. There are even indications that the earliest
customs may have gone beyond those of the Egyptians
in exalting women. All the available evidence
points to the conclusion that at the opening of
Babylonian history women had complete independence
and equal rights with their husbands and
brothers. It is significant that the most archaic
texts in the primitive language are remarkable
for the precedence given to the female sex in all
formulas of address: &#8220;Goddesses and gods;&#8221;
&#8220;Women and men,&#8221; are mentioned always in that
order; this is in itself a decisive indication of the
high status of women in this early period. And
there are other traces all pointing to the conclusion
that in the civilisation of primitive Babylon mother-right
was still in active force. Later (as is shown
by the Code of Hammurabi) a woman&#8217;s rights, though
not her duties, were more circumscribed; in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
still later Neo-Babylonian periods, she again acquired,
through the favourable conditions with
regard to property, full liberty of action and equal
rights with her husband.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>Let us now turn our attention to the Gr&aelig;co-Roman
civilisation. It is convenient to take first
a brief glance at Rome. I may note that the family
here would certainly appear to have developed from
the primitive clan, or <i>gens</i>. At the dawn of history
the patriarchal system was already firmly established,
with individual property, and an unusually
strong subjection of woman to her father first and
afterwards to her husband. There are, however,
numerous indications of a prehistoric phase of
communism. I can mention only the right of the
<i>gens</i> to the heritage, and in certain cases the possession
of an <i>ager publicus</i>, which certainly bears
witness in favour of an antique community of
property.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Can we, then, accept that there was
once a period of the maternal family, when descent
and inheritance were traced through the mother?
Frazer<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> has brought forward facts which point to
the view that the Roman kingship was transmitted
in the female line; and, if this can be accepted, we
may fairly conclude that at one time the maternal
customs were in force. The plebeian marriage ceremonies
of Rome should be noted. The funeral inscriptions
in Etruria in the Latin language make
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>much greater insistence on the maternal than the
paternal descent; giving usually the name of the
mother alone, or indicating the father&#8217;s name by a
simple initial, whilst that of the mother is written in
full.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> This is very significant. Very little trustworthy
evidence, however, is forthcoming, and of the position
of women in Rome in the earliest periods we know
little or nothing. And for this reason I shall refer
my readers to what I have written elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> on
this matter; merely saying that there are indications
and traditions pointing to the view that here, as in
so many great civilisations, women&#8217;s actions were
once unfettered, and this, as I believe, can be explained
only on the hypothesis of the existence of a
maternal stage, before the establishment of the individual
male authority under the patriarchal system.</p>

<p>The evidence with regard to prehistoric Greece
is much more complete. The Greek &#947;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#962; resembled
the Roman <i>gens</i>. Its members had a common
sepulture, common property, the mutual obligation
of the <i>vendetta</i> and archon.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> In the prehistoric
clans maternal descent would seem to have been
established. Plutarch relates that the Cretans
spoke of Crete as their motherland, and not fatherland.
In primitive Athens, the women had the
right of voting, and their children bore their name&mdash;privileges
that were taken from them, says the
legend, to appease the wrath of Poseidon, after
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>his inundation of the city, owing to the quarrel
with Athene. Tradition also relates that at Athens,
until the time of Cecrops, children bore the name
of their mother.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> Among the Lycians, whose
affinity to the Greeks was so pronounced, a matriarchate
prevailed down to the time of Herodotus.
Not the name only, but the inheritance and status
of the children depended on the mother. The
Lycians &#8220;honoured women rather than men;&#8221;
they are represented &#8220;as being accustomed from
of old to be ruled by their women.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>One of the most remarkable instances of a gyn&aelig;cocratic
people has only now been fully discovered
as having existed in ancient Crete. It seems
probable that women enjoyed greater powers than
they had even in Egypt. The new evidence that
has come to light is certainly most interesting; the
facts are recorded by Mr. J.&nbsp;R. Hall in a recent book,
<i>Ancient History in the Far East</i>, and I am specially
glad to bring them forward. He affirms: &#8220;It may
eventually appear that in religious matters, perhaps
even the government of the State itself as well,
were largely controlled by the women.&#8221; From the
seals we gather a universal worship of a supreme
female goddess, the Rhea of later religions, who
is accompanied sometimes by a youthful male deity.
Wherever we find this preponderating feminine
principle in worship we shall find also a corresponding
feminine influence in the customs of the people.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>We have seen this, for instance, among the Khasis,
where also goddesses are placed before gods. Mr.
Hall further states: &#8220;It is certain that they [the
women in Crete] must have lived on a footing of
greater equality with men than in any other ancient
civilisation.&#8221; And again: &#8220;We see in the frescoes
of Knossos conclusive indications of an open and
free association of men and women, corresponding
to our idea of &#8216;Society,&#8217; at the Minoan court,
unparalleled till our own day.&#8221; The women are
unveiled, and the costumes and setting are extraordinarily
modern. Mr. Hall draws attention to
the curious fact that in appearance the women are
very similar to the men, so that often the sexes can
be distinguished only by the conventions of the
artists, representing the women in white, and the
men in red outline; the same convention that was
used in Egypt. I may recall to the reader the
likeness of the men to the women among the North
American Indians, and the same similarity between
the sexes occurs among the ancient Egyptians.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> It
is perhaps impossible to search for an explanation.
I would, however, point out that in all these cases,
where the sexes appear to be more alike than is
common, we find women in a position of equality
with men. This is really very remarkable; I think
it is a fact that demands more attention than as
yet it has received.</p>

<p>At one time there would seem to have been in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>prehistoric Greece a period of fully established
mother-right. Ancient Attic traditions are filled
with recollections of female supremacy. Women
in the Homeric legends hold a position and enjoy
a freedom wholly at variance with a patriarchal
subjection. Not infrequently the husband owes to
his wife his rank and his wealth; always the wife
possesses a dignified place and much influence.
Even the formal elevation of women to positions
of authority is not uncommon. &#8220;There is nothing,&#8221;
says Homer, &#8220;better and nobler than when husband
and wife, being of one mind, rule a household.
Penelope and Clytemnestra were left in charge of
the realms of their husbands during their absence
in Troy; the beautiful Chloris ruled as queen in
Pylos. Arete, the beloved wife of Alcinous played
an important part as peacemaker in the kingdom
of her husband.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>If we turn to the evidence of the ancient mythology
and art, it is also clear that the number of female
deities must be connected with the early predominance
of women in Greece. We have to remember
that &#8220;the gods&#8221; are shaped by human beings in
their own image, and the status of women on earth
is reflected in the status of a goddess. Five out of
the eight divinities of immemorial Greek worship
were female, Hera, Demeter, Persephone, Athene
and Aphrodite. In addition there were numerous
lesser goddesses. One must consider also that it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>was not uncommon for cities to be named after
women; and the Greek stories seem to point to
tribes with totem names. How can these things
be explained, unless we accept a maternal stage?
There are numerous other facts all indicating this
same conclusion. We find relationships on the
mother&#8217;s side regarded as much more close than
those on the father&#8217;s side. In Athens and Sparta
a man might marry his father&#8217;s sister, but not his
mother&#8217;s sister. Lycaon, in pleading with Achilles,
says in order to appease him, that he is not the
uterine brother of Hector. It is also noteworthy
to find that the Thebans, when pressed in war, seek
assistance from the &AElig;ginetans as their nearest kin,
<i>recollecting that Thebe and &AElig;ginia had been sisters</i>.
A similar case is that of the Lycaones in Crete, who
claimed affinity with Athens and with Sparta, which
affinity was traced through the mother.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>There is much evidence I am compelled to pass
over. It must, however, be noted that there seems
clear proof of the maternal form of marriage having
at one time been practised. Plutarch mentions
that the relations between husband and wife in
Sparta were at first secret.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> The story told by
Pausanias about Ulysses&#8217; marriage certainly points
to the custom of the bridegroom going to live with
the wife&#8217;s family.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> In this connection the action
of Intaphernes is significant, who, when granted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>by Darius permission to claim the life of a single
man, chose her brother, saying that both husband
and children could be replaced.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> Similarly the
declaration of Antigone that neither for husband
nor children would she have performed the toil she
undertook for Polynices<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> clearly shows that the
tie of the common womb was held as closer than
the tie of marriage; and this points to the conditions
of the communal clan.</p>

<p>Andromache, when she relates to Hector how
her father&#8217;s house has been destroyed, with all who
are in it, turns to him and says: &#8220;But now, Hector,
thou art my father and gracious mother, thou art
my brother, nay, thou art my valiant husband.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>
It is easy, I think, to see in this speech how the
early idea of the relationships under mother-right
had been transferred to the husband, as the protector
of the woman conditioned by father-right. As in
so many countries, the patriarchal authority of the
husband does not seem to have existed in Greece at
this early stage of development. It may, however,
be said that all this, though proving the high
status of women in the prehistoric period, does not
establish the existence of the maternal family. I
would ask: how, then, are these mother-right
customs to be explained? In the later history
of Greece, with the family based on patriarchal
authority, all this was changed. We find women
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>occupying a much less favourable position, their
rights and freedom more and more restricted. In
Sparta alone, where the old customs for long were
preserved, did the women retain anything of their
old dignity and influence. The Athenian wives,
under the authority of their husbands, sank almost
to the level of slaves.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>The patriarchal system is connected closely in our
thought with the Hebrew family, where the father,
who is chief, holds grouped under his despotic sway
his wives, their children, and slaves. Yet this
Semitic patriarch has not existed from the beginning;
numerous survivals of mother-right customs
afford proof that the Hebrew race must have passed
through a maternal stage. These survivals have a
special interest, as we are all familiar with them in
Bible history, but we have not understood their
significance. It is possible to give a few illustrations
only. In the history of Jacob&#8217;s service for his wives,
we have clear proof of the maternal custom of <i>beenah</i>
marriage. As a suitor Jacob had to buy his position
as husband and to serve Laban for seven years
before he was permitted to marry Leah, and seven
years for Rachel, while six further years of service
were claimed before he was allowed the possession
of his cattle.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> Afterwards, when he wished to
depart with his wives and his children, Laban made
the objection, &#8220;these daughters are my daughters,
and these children are my children.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> Now, according
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>to the patriarchal custom, Laban&#8217;s daughters
should have been cut off from their father by
marriage, and become of the kindred of their
husbands. Such a claim on the part of the father
proves the subordinate position held by the husband
in the wife&#8217;s family, who retained control over her
and the children of the marriage, and even over the
personal property of the man, as was usual under
the later matriarchal custom. Even when the
marriage is not in the maternal form, and the wife
goes to the husband&#8217;s home, we find compensation
has to be paid to her kindred. Thus when Abraham
sought a wife for Isaac, presents were taken by the
messenger to induce the bride to leave her home;
and these presents were given not to the father of
the bride, but to her mother and brother.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> This is
the early form of purchase marriage, such bridal-gifts
being the forerunners of the payment of a
fixed bride-price. We still find purchase marriage
practised side by side with <i>beenah</i> marriage in the
countries where the transitional stage has been
reached and mother-right contends with father-right.
But there is stronger evidence even than
these two cases. The injunction in Gen. ii, 24:
&#8220;Therefore shall a man leave his father and his
mother, and shall cleave unto his wife,&#8221; refers
without any doubt to the early form of marriage
under mother-right, when the husband left his own
kindred and went to live with his wife and among
her people. We find Samson visiting his Philistine
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>wife who remained with her own people.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> Even
the obligation to blood vengeance rested apparently
on the maternal kinsmen (Judges viii, 19). The
Hebrew father did not inherit from the son, nor
the grandfather from the grandson, which points
back to a time when the children did not belong to
the clan of the father.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> Among the Hebrews
individual property was instituted at a very early
period,<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> but various customs show clearly the early
existence of communal clans. Thus the inheritance,
especially the paternal inheritance, must remain in
the clan &#8220;then shall their inheritance be added
unto the inheritance of the tribe.&#8221; Marriage in the
tribe is obligatory for daughters. &#8220;Let them marry
to whom they think best; only to the family of the
tribe of their father shall they marry. So shall no
inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe
to tribe.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> We have here an indication of the close
relation between father-right and property.</p>

<p>Under mother-right there is naturally no prohibition
against marriage with a half-sister upon the
father&#8217;s side. This explains the marriage of Abraham
with Sarah, his half-sister by the same father. When
reproached for having passed his wife off as his
sister to the King of Egypt, the patriarch replies:
&#8220;For indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter
of my father, but not the daughter of my mother,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>and she became my wife.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> In the same way
Tamar could have married her half-brother Amnon,
though they were both the children of David:
&#8220;Speak to the King, for he will not withhold me
from thee.&#8221; And it was her uterine brother,
Absalom, who revenged the rape of Tamar by
slaying; afterwards he fled to the kindred of his
mother.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Again, the father of Moses and Aaron
married his father&#8217;s sister, who legally was not
considered to be related to him.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> Nabor, the
brother of Abraham, took to wife his fraternal
niece, the daughter of his brother.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> It was only
later that paternal kinship became legally recognised
among the Hebrews by the same titles as the
natural kinship through the mother.</p>

<p>It is by considering these survivals of mother-right
in connection with similar customs to be
found among existing maternal peoples that we
see their true significance. They warrant us in
believing that the patriarchal family, as we know
it among the Hebrews and elsewhere, was a later
stage of an evolution, which had for its starting-point
the communal clan, and that these races have
passed through the maternal phase. We come to
understand the change in the privileged position of
women. As the husband and father continued to
gain in power, with the reassertion of individual
interests, it was inevitable that the mother should
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>lose the authority she had held, under the free
social organisation of the undivided clan.</p>

<p>Traces of a similar evolution of the family may,
I am convinced, be found by all who will undertake
an inquiry for themselves. The subject is one of
great interest. So far as my own study goes, I
believe that these survivals of the maternal-group
customs may be discovered in the early history
of every people, where the necessary material for
such knowledge is available. I wish it were possible
for me even to summarise all the evidence, direct
and inferential, that I have collected for my own
satisfaction. I must reluctantly pass over many
countries I would like to include; some of these&mdash;China,
Japan, Burma and Madagascar&mdash;have been
noticed briefly in <i>The Truth about Woman</i>.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> There
is surprising similarity between the facts; and, the
more of such survivals that can be found, the more
the evidence seems to grow in favour of the acceptance
of a universal maternal stage in the evolution
of society.</p>

<p>I must now, before closing this chapter (whose
accumulation of facts may, I fear, have wearied
my readers), refer briefly to the races of barbarous
Europe. The point of interest is, of course&mdash;how
far mother-right may be accepted, as at one period,
having existed. The earliest direct evidence is the
account given by Strabo of the Iberians of ancient
Spain. And first it is important to note that the
Iberians belonged to the Berber race, now widely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>regarded as the parent of the chief and largest
element in the population of Europe. There is
another fact that must be noted. The general
characteristic of the Berber family seems to have
been the privileged position they accorded to their
women, privileges so great that we meet with strong
tendencies towards the matriarchate. This last is
still in force among the Touaregs of the Sahara;
and there are as well numerous traces of its former
existence among the neighbouring Kabyles, though
there the most rigorous patriarchate has replaced
the maternal family.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> We have seen, too, that in
ancient Egypt, where the Berbers were largely
represented, women enjoyed a position of extraordinary
freedom and authority.</p>

<p>Bearing this in mind, we may accept the statement
of Strabo: &#8220;Among the Cantabrians usage requires
that the husband shall bring a dower to his wife,
and the daughters inherit, being charged with the
marriage of their brothers, which constitutes a kind
of gyn&aelig;cocracy.&#8221; There is possibly some exaggeration
in the term gyn&aelig;cocracy; yet if there is no proof
of &#8220;rule by women,&#8221; there can be no doubt that,
through the system of female inheritance, property
was held by them, and this must certainly have
given them the power always involved by the
possession of wealth.</p>

<p>The freedom of the women of ancient Spain is
sufficiently indicated by the fact that they took
part in the activities usually considered as belonging
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>to men. It was these women who played their part
in driving back the Roman legions from the mountainous
districts of northern Spain; we read of them
fighting side by side with men, where they used
their weapons with courage and determination.
They received their wounds with silent fortitude,
and no cry of pain ever escaped their lips, even
when the wounds which laid them low were mortal.
To women as well as men liberty was a possession
more valued than life, and, when taken prisoners,
they fell upon their own swords, and dashed their
little ones to death rather than suffer them to live
to be slaves. Nor were the activities of women
confined to warfare. Justin speaks of women as
not only having the care of all domestic matters,
but also cultivating the fields. And Strabo, writing
of these Amazons, tells us that they would often
step aside out of the furrows &#8220;to be brought to
bed,&#8221; and then, having borne a child, would return
to their work &#8220;just as if they had only laid an egg.&#8221;
He notes, too, as being practised among them the
<i>couvade</i>, whereby the husband, in assertion of his
legal fatherhood, retired to bed when a child was
born.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>Spain is a land that I know well, and for this
reason I have chosen to write of it in fuller detail.
Persistent relics of the early maternal period even
yet may be traced in the customs of this strongly
conservative people. Women are held in honour.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>There is a proverb common all over Spain to the
effect that &#8220;he who is unfortunate and needs
assistance should seek his mother.&#8221; Many primitive
customs survive, and one of the most interesting
is that by which the eldest daughter in some cases
takes precedence over the sons in inheritance.
Among the Basques, until quite recently, the administration
of the family property passed to the
eldest child, whether a boy or a girl; and in the
case of a daughter, her husband was obliged to take
the name of the family and to live in the wife&#8217;s
home. Spanish women always retain their own
names after marriage, and as far back as the fourth
century we find them at the Synod of Elvira resisting
an attempt to limit this freedom. The
practice is still common for children to use the
name of the mother coupled with that of the father,
and even, in some cases, alone, showing a quite
unusual absence of preference for paternal descent.
This is very significant. It explains the recognition
given in old Spain to the unmarried mother; even
to-day in no country, that I know, does less social
stigma fall on a child born out of wedlock. The
profound Spanish veneration of the Virgin Mary,
as well as the number of female saints, is another
indication of the honour paid to women, which
must, I am certain, be connected with a far back
time when goddesses were worshipped. I would
note, too, the fine Spanish understanding of hospitality.
This belongs to the ideals of communal
life. I know nothing to equal it in the common<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
habits of other European countries. It may be
compared with the conditions in the joint-family
communities of the American Indians.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>Much more might be said on the position of the
Spanish women. I have, however, written elsewhere
of these women,<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> of their intelligence, and
strength, and beauty, and of the active part they
take still in the industrial life of the country. There
can be no question that some features of the maternal
customs have left their imprint on the domestic life
of Spain, and this, as I believe, explains how women
here have in certain directions, preserved a freedom
of action and privileges, which even in England have
never been established, and only of late claimed.</p>

<p>As we may expect, there is less direct evidence
of mother-right in the other European countries
than is the case in conservative Spain. Dargun,
who has written much on this subject,<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> believes
that maternal descent was formerly practised among
the Germans. He holds further &#8220;that the ancient
Aryans at the time of their dispersion regarded
kinship through the mother as the sole, or chief,
basis of blood-kinship, and all their family rights
were governed by this principle.&#8221; There is much
conflict of opinion on this matter, and it would,
perhaps, be rash to make any definite statement.
We may recall what Tacitus says of the Germans:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;The son of a sister is as dear to his uncle as to
his father; some even think that the first of these
ties is the most sacred and close; and in taking
hostages they prefer nephews, as inspiring a stronger
attachment, and interesting the family on more
sides.&#8221; The same authority tells us that the
Germans of his day met together to take a clan
meal, to settle clan business, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> for the clan
council&mdash;and to arrange marriages. This is strong
confirmation of what I am trying to establish.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>
Further evidence may be gathered from the ancient
religion. There are many Teutonic goddesses, who
may well be connected with the primitive tribal-mothers.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>
Religion here, as so often elsewhere,
would seem to have been symbolised as feminine.
Not only the seers, but the sacrificers among the
early Teutons were women.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> To this evidence may
be added that in Germany up to a late period the
mother could be the guardian of her children; that
a wife had to be bought by the husband, both she
and her children remaining under the guardianship
of her father. All this points to mother-right and
the existence of the maternal clan.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> Let us note
also that in the Slav communities women had the
right to vote, and might be elected to the government
of the community.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p><p>It will interest my readers to know that mother-descent
must once have prevailed in Britain.
Among the Picts of Scotland kingship was transmitted
through women.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> Bede tells us that down
to his own time&mdash;the early part of the eighth
century&mdash;whenever a doubt arose as to the succession,
the Picts chose their king from the female
rather than from the male line.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> There is an ancient
legend which represents the Irish as giving three
hundred wives to the Picts, on the condition that
the succession to the crown should always be
through their females&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;There were oathes imposed on them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the stars, by the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That from the nobility of the mother<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should always be the right to the sovereignty.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Similar traces are found in England: Canute, the
Dane, when acknowledged King of England, married
Emma, the widow of his predecessor, Ethelred.
Ethelbald, King of Kent, married his stepmother,
after the death of his father Ethelbert; and, as late
as the ninth century, Ethelbald, King of the West
Saxons, wedded Judith, the widow of his father.
Such marriages are intelligible only if we suppose
that the queen had the power of conferring the kingdom
upon her consort, which could only happen
where maternal descent was, or had been, practised.
These marriages with the widow of a king were at
one time very common. The familiar example of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>Hamlet&#8217;s uncle is one, who, after murdering his
brother, married his wife and became king. His
acceptance by the people, in spite of his crime, is
explained if it was the old Danish custom for
marriage with the king&#8217;s widow to carry the kingdom
with it. In Hamlet&#8217;s position as avenger,
and his curious hesitancy, we have really an indication
of the conflict between the old and the
new ways of descent.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p>The Celtic population of Britain preserved the
institution of the clan much longer than the other
European races. In Wales and in Ireland, in particular,
communism was strongly established. The
clan was responsible for the crimes of its members,
paid the fines, and received the compensations.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
There are numerous indications of mother-right.
In Ireland women retained a very high position
and much freedom, both before and after marriage,
to a late period: temporary unions were freely
allowed, and customs having the force of law safeguarded
the rights of the wife. &#8220;Every woman,&#8221;
it was said, &#8220;is to go the way she willeth freely.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>The early Celtic mythologies and folk-records are
full of these survivals. Goddesses are frequent as
primeval tribal-mothers. Let me give one instance.
The Irish goddess Brigit (whose attributes at a later
date were transferred to St. Bridget) is referred
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>to in a ninth-century glossary as&mdash;<i>operum atque
artificiorum initia</i>. She was the tribal-mother of
the Bringantes. Similarly Vote was tribal-mother of
the Burgundians; and the goddess Bil of the Billings,
and there are numerous other cases. In a recent
book on <i>Ulster Folk-lore</i>,<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> I have been fortunate
enough to find a most interesting passage referring
to the Irish goddess Brigit. I quote it with pleasure
as a fitting ending to this chapter.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Now, St. Bridget had a pagan predecessor, Brigit,
a poetess of the Tuatha de Danann, and whom we
may perhaps regard as a female Apollo. Cormac in
his <i>Glossary</i> tells us she was a daughter of the Dagda
and a goddess whom all poets adored, and whose
sisters were Brigit the physician and Brigit the
smith. Probably the three sisters represent the
same divine, or semi-divine, person whom we may
identify with the British goddess Brigantia and the
Gaulish Brigindo.&#8221;</p></div>

on &#8220;Old English Clans&#8221; (<i>Cornhill</i>, Sept. 1881); this I had
not read when I wrote this chapter. The author holds
that the clan system was once common to the whole
Aryan race. In the Teutonic stock its memory died out
in an early stage of development, owing to the strong
individuality of the Teutonic mind. Yet it has left behind
it many traces. Numerous examples are given. Perhaps
the most interesting is the evidence showing that totemism
seems to have existed; the clan names being taken from
animals or plants.</p></div>

<h3>THE SURVIVALS OF MOTHER-RIGHT IN FOLK-LORE,<br />
IN HEROIC LEGENDS, AND IN FAIRY STORIES</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the preceding chapter we have found the former
existence of the maternal family, or some indication
of it, in the early records of many races, proving
this by numerous survivals of customs entirely at
variance with the patriarchal conditions. Should it
be thought that this claim has not been supported
by sufficient evidence, I must plead the difficulties
of such an inquiry. My survey has been very incomplete.
I am certain, however, that these survivals
will be recognised by any one who will undertake for
themselves the collection and interpretation of the
facts from the records of the past.</p>

<p>There is a point to consider here. The absence, or
rather the rarity, of mother-right survivals in some
civilisations cannot be counted as proof that the
maternal system never existed. As I have shown
in the earlier chapters of this book, the mother-age
was a transitional stage, between the very early
brute-conditions of the family and the second firmly
established patriarchate. Now, it is clear that the
customs of a transitional stage are very likely to
disappear; they are also very likely to be mistaken.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Bearing this in mind, the number of survivals that
do occur are, I hold, extraordinary, and, indeed,
impossible to account for if the maternal family
was not a universal stage in the development of
society. Moreover, I am certain from my own study
that these survivals are of much wider occurrence
than is believed, but as yet the facts are insufficiently
established.</p>

<p>It now remains to consider a new field of inquiry;
and that is the abundant evidence of mother-right
to be found in folk-lore, in heroic legends, and in
the fairy-stories of our children. There is a special
value in these old-world stories, that date back to
a time long before written history. They belong to
all countries in slightly different forms. We have
regarded them as fables, but there was never a
fable that did not arise out of truth&mdash;not, of course,
the outside truth of facts, but from that inward
truth of the life and thought of a people, which is
what really matters. I cannot, then, do better
than conclude the evidence for the mother-age
by referring to some few of these myths and
legends.</p>

<p>In order to group the great mass of material I
will take first the creation myths. One only out
of many examples can be given. The Zu&ntilde;i Indians,
who, it will be remembered, are a maternal people,
give this account of the beginning of the world.
We read how the Sun-god, withdrawing strength
from his flesh, impregnated the great waters, until
there arose upon them, waxing wide and weighty,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
the &#8220;Fourfold Mother-earth&#8221; and the &#8220;All-covering
Father-sky.&#8221;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;From the lying together of these twain, upon
the great world water, so vitalising, life was conceived,
whence began all beings of the earth, men
and creatures, in the four-fold womb of the world.
Thereupon the Earth-mother repulsed the Sky-father,
growing big and sinking deep into the
embrace of the waters below, thus separated from
the Sky-father, in the embrace of the waters above.&#8221;
The story states, &#8220;Warm is the Earth-mother and
cold the Sky-father, even as woman is warm and
man is cold.&#8221; Then it goes on, &#8220;&#8216;So is thy will,&#8217;
said the Sky-father, &#8216;yet not alone shalt thou
helpful be unto our children&#8217;;&#8221; and we learn how
the Sky-father assisted the Earth-mother. &#8220;Thus
in other ways, many diversed, they worked for their
offspring.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p></div>

<p>There is one reflection only I desire to offer on
this most beautiful maternal version of the creation
legend. Here we find complete understanding of
the woman&#8217;s part; she is the one who gives life;
she is the active partner. The Sky-father is represented
as her agent, her helper. Why should this
be? Contrast this idea with the patriarchal creation
story of the Bible.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;And the Lord God said, It is not good that man
should be alone; I will make him an help meet
for him.... And the Lord God caused a deep
sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and he
took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>thereof: and the rib which the Lord God had taken
from the man made he a woman, and brought her
unto the man. And the man said, This is now
bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall
be called Woman, because she was taken out of
Man.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p></div>

<p>I would again assert my strong belief that in the
religious conception of a people we find the true
thoughts and the customs of the period in which
they originated. A patriarchal people could not
have given expression to a creation myth in which
the female idea prevailed, and the mother, and not
the father, was dominant. For men have ever
fashioned the gods in their own human image,
endowing them with their thoughts and actions.
The sharp change in the view of woman&#8217;s part in
the relationship of the sexes is clearly symbolised
in these creation myths. Yes, it marks the degradation
of woman; she has fallen from the maternal
conception of the feminine principle, guiding, directing,
and using the male, to that of the woman made
for the man in the patriarchal Bible story.</p>

<p>Another group of legends that I would notice
refer to the conflict between the right of the mother
and that of the father in relation to the children.
These stories belong to a period of transition. In
ancient Greece, as we have seen, the paternal family
succeeded the maternal clan. In his <i>Orestia</i>,
&AElig;schylus puts in opposition before Pallas Athene
the right of the mother and the right of the father.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>The chorus of the Eumenides, representing the
people, defends the position of the mother; Apollo
pleads for the father, and ends by declaring, in a
fit of patriarchal delirium, that <i>the child is not of
the blood of the mother</i>. &#8220;It is not the mother who
begets what is called her child; she is only the
nurse of the germ poured into her womb; he who
begets is the father. The woman receives the germ
merely as guardian, and when it pleases the gods,
she preserves it.&#8221; Plato also brings forward this
view, and states that the mother contributes nothing
to the child&#8217;s being. &#8220;The mother is to the child
what the soil is to the plant; it owes its nourishment
to her, but the essence and structure of its nature
are derived from the father.&#8221; Again the Orestes
of Euripides takes up the same theory, when he
says to Tyndarus: &#8220;My father has begotten me,
and thy daughter has given birth to me, as the
earth receives the seed that another confides to it.&#8221;
Here we trace a different world of thoughts and
conceptions; the mother was so little esteemed as
to be degraded into the mere nourisher of the child.
These patriarchal theories naturally consecrated the
slavery of woman.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>Another point strikingly illustrated by many of
these ancient legends is the struggle for power
between the two sexes&mdash;a struggle that would
seem to have been present at all stages of civilisation,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>but always most active in periods of transition.
One out of many examples is all that I can give.
In Hawaii, worship is given to the goddess Pele,
the personification of the volcano Kilauea, and the
god Tamapua, the personification of the sea, or
rather, of the storm which lashes the sea and hurls
wave after wave upon the land. The myth tells
that Tamapua wooed Pele, who rejected his suit,
whereupon he flooded the crater with water, but Pele
drank up the water and drove him back into the sea.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>Here a brief digression into the early mythologies
may be made, although this question of the connection
between mother-right and religious ideas
is one on which I have already enlarged. The most
primitive theogony is that of Mother-Earth and her
son. Goddesses are at first of greater importance
than gods. The Earth-mother springs from chaos,
and in the beginning her children have no father.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>
Traces of such a goddess are to be found in many
ancient religions. Afterwards as a modification, or
rather a development, of the Earth-mother, we have
the goddesses of fertility. This idea arose with the
development of agriculture, and was closely connected
in the primitive mind with the sex functions.
Demeter is of this type; and there are many of
these mother-deities who once were universally
worshipped. Virgin goddesses are a much later
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>creation, and must be connected with the patriarchal
ideals for women. The original god-idea
symbolised as woman is the free mother; she
is the source of all fertility; she is the goddess
of love. The servants of these goddesses were
priestesses, or at a later date men dressed as women.
At first the gods, in so far as they had any existence,
appear in the form of temporary lovers of the goddesses;
they are very plainly the transitory male
element needful for fertilisation, and then destined
to disappear.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> We find very early the brother as
the husband and dependent of the Mother-goddess.
Thus Isis did not change or lose her independent
position after her marriage to her brother Osiris;
her importance as a deity remained always greater
than his.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> Only at a much later stage&mdash;the
patriarchal stage&mdash;was the wandering lover-god or
dependent brother-spouse raised to the position of
authority of the All-Father. We may find in the
religious sexual festivals, common to all civilisations,
abundant confirmation of these facts. As one
illustration out of many that might be chosen, I
will refer to the account given by Prof. K. Pearson<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>
of the festival of Sak&auml;&#275;s, held in Babylon in honour
of the great goddess Mylitta, who was essentially
a mother-goddess of fertility. The festival lasted
for five days in the month of July. It was presided
over by the priestess of the goddess, who represented
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>the goddess herself. She sat enthroned on a mound
which for the time was the sanctuary of the deity,
with the altar with oil and incense before her. To
her came the god-lover represented by a slave,
who made homage and worshipped. From her he
received the symbols of kingly power, and she raised
him to the throne by her side. As her accepted
lover and lord of the festival, he remained for five
days, during which the law of the goddess prevailed.
Afterwards on the fifth day the god-lover was
sacrificed on the pyre. The male element had
performed its function.</p>

<p>I cannot leave this subject without emphasising
the importance of these erotic-religious festivals,
once of universal occurrence. They afford the
strongest evidence of the early privileged position
of women in the relationships between the two
sexes. It is, I think, impossible to avoid giving
to this a matriarchal interpretation. For it is by
contrasting the religious-sex standpoints of the
maternal and the paternal ideals that the inferior
position of women under the later system can be
demonstrated. Moreover, in much later periods,
and even to our own day, we may yet find broken
survivals of the old customs. Illustrations are not
far to seek in the common festivals of the people
in Germany and elsewhere, and as I have myself
witnessed them in Spain, a land which has preserved
its old customs much more unchanged than is
usual.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> One example may be noted in England,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>which would seem to have a very ancient origin;
it is given by Prof. K. Pearson.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> &#8220;The Roman
<i>Lupercalia</i> held on February 15 was essentially a
worship of fertility, and the privileges supposed to
be attached to women in our own country during
this month&mdash;especially on February 14 and 29&mdash;are
probably fossils of the same sex-freedom.&#8221;</p>

<p>Passing again to the old legends, we find not a
few that attempt to account for both the rise and
the decline of the custom of maternal descent. I
will give an example of each. Newbold relates that
in Menangkabowe, where the female line is observed,
it is accounted for by this legend&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Perpati Sabatang built a magnificent vessel,
which he loaded with gold and precious stones so
heavily that it got aground on the sands at the
foot of the fiery mountains, and resisted the efforts
of all the men to get it off. The sages were consulted,
and declared that all attempts would be in
vain until the vessel had passed over the body of
a pregnant woman. It happened that the Rajah&#8217;s
own daughter was in the condition desired; she was
called upon to immolate herself for the sake of her
country, but refused. At this juncture the pregnant
sister of the Rajah boldly stepped forward,
and cast herself beneath the prow of the vessel,
which instantly put itself in motion, and again
floated on the waves without injury to the princess.
Whereupon the Rajah disinherited the offspring of
his disobedient daughter in favour of the child of
his sister, and caused this to be enrolled in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>records of the empire as the law of succession in
time to come.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p></div>

<p>The second illustration is taken from the quarrel
between Pallas Athene and Poseidon to which
already I have referred. The myth tells us&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;A double wonder sprang out of the earth at the
same time&mdash;at one place the olive tree and at
another water. The people in terror sent to Delphi
to ask what should be done. The god answered
that the olive tree signified the power of Athene,
and the water that of Poseidon; and that it remained
with the burgesses to choose after which of
the two they would name their town. An assembly
was called of the burgesses, both men and women,
for it was then the custom to let the women take part
in the public councils. The men voted for Poseidon,
the women for Athene; and as there were more
women than men by one, Athene conquered. Thereupon
Poseidon was enraged, and immediately the
sea flowed over all the lands of Athens. To appease
the sea-god, the burgesses found it necessary to impose
a threefold punishment on their wives. They
were to lose their votes; the children were to receive
no more the mother&#8217;s name, and they themselves
were no longer to be called after the goddess.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p></div>

<p>The origin of these myths is perfectly clear. There
is no reason to force their interpretation by regarding
them as historical evidence of a struggle taking place
between the maternal and the paternal custom of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>tracing descent;<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> rather they are poetical explanations,
plainly invented to account for women&#8217;s
predominance at a time when such power had come
to be considered as unusual. The same may be
said of many of these old myths. Man&#8217;s fancy
begins to weave poetic inventions around anything
he considers abnormal or is not able to understand.
The idea or custom for which an explanation is
being sought must, however, have been present for
long in the common life and thought of the people.
Without realising this, all these old stories become
unintelligible. I believe they have been greatly
misinterpreted in the thought of writers bound by
patriarchal ideas.</p>

<p>The limitation of my space does not allow me to
enter into the great amount of evidence provided
by these mythical stories of the privileged position
of women. One instance, however, may be referred
to as an illustration. We find a wide range of stories
connected with the mythical Amazons. Now, if I
am right, the frequency of these legends among so
many races points to the acceptance of the Amazon
heroines as an historical fact. Fancy, without
doubt, wove the details of their stories, occurrences
would be chosen or imagined to give colour to the
narratives, but such poetic inventions, with all
their repetitions, all their reproductions of what
is practically one situation, would take only definite
form from conditions so impressed on the popular
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>mind by facts that must have had a real existence.
Bearing this in mind, special significance attaches
to a discovery recently made by Prof. d&#8217;Allosso.
In the ancient necropolis of Belmonte, dating from
the iron age, are two very rich tombs of women
warriors with war chariots over their remains.
Prof. d&#8217;Allosso states that several details given by
Virgil of the Amazon Camilla, who fought and died on
the field of battle, coincide with the details on these
tombs. The importance of this discovery is thus
very great, as it certainly seems to indicate what I
am claiming&mdash;that the existence of the Amazon
heroines, leaders of armies and sung by the ancient
poets, is not a poetic fancy, but an historic reality.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p>I must turn now to the last group of evidence
that I am able to bring forward; to find this we
must enter that realm of fancy&mdash;the world of fairyland.
We shall see that this land has its own customs,
and its own laws, entirely at variance with all
those to which we are accustomed. How is this to be
explained? These stories are founded really on the
life of the common people, and they have come down
from generation to generation, handed on by the
storytellers, from a time long before the day when
they were ever collected and written in books. It
is the popular and social character of these stories
that is so important; they are records of customs
and habits long forgotten, but once common in the
daily life of the people. In them the past is potent
with life, and for this reason they claim the most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>careful and patient study. I speak of the most
familiar stories that we have regarded as foolish
fables. Nowhere else can we gain so clear and
vivid a picture of the childhood of civilisation, when
women were the transmitters of inheritance and the
guardians of property.</p>

<p>Let me try to prove this. I have before me a
collection of these folk-stories, gathered from many
countries. Now, the most popular story (whose
theme occurs again and again, the details varied
in the different renderings) is concerned with the
gaining of a princess as a bride by a wooer, usually
of humble birth. This lover to obtain his wife
achieves some mighty deed of valour, or performs
tasks set for him by the parents of the bride; he
thus inherits the kingdom through the daughter
of the king. Hans, faring forth to seek his luck; the
Dummling in the Golden Goose story; the miller&#8217;s
son, who gained his bride by the wit of his cat,
and Aladdin with his magic lamp are well-known
examples of this story. The Scottish and Irish
legends are particularly rich in examples of these
hero lovers. Assipattle, the dirty ash-lad, who wins
the fair Gemdelovely and then reigns with her
as queen and king, is one of the most interesting.
Similar stories may be found in the folk-lore of every
country. Ash-lad figures in many of the Norwegian
tales. There is a charming version in the Lapp
story of the &#8220;Silk Weaver and her husband,&#8221;
where we read, &#8220;Once upon a time a poor lad
wooed a princess and the girl wanted to marry him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
but the Emperor was against the match. Nevertheless
she took him at last and they were wed
together.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>This &#8220;fairy theory&#8221; of marriage is really the
maternal or <i>beenah</i> form: such a marriage as was
made by Jacob and is still common among all
maternal peoples. The inheritance passes through
the daughters; the suitors gain their position by
some deed of valour or by service done for the
bride&#8217;s family; sometimes it is the mother who sets
the task, more often it is the father, while, in some
cases, the girl herself imposes the conditions of
marriage. It is possible to trace a development
in these stories. We can see the growth of purchase-marriage
in the service demanded by the parents
of the bride, this taking the place of the earlier
custom of the bridegroom proving his fitness by
some test of strength. Again, those stories in which
the arrangement of the marriage remains with the
mother or with the girl, and not with the father,
must be regarded as the older versions. This change
appears also in the conditions of inheritance; in
some cases the kingdom passes at once with the
bride, in others the half of the kingdom is the
marriage portion, while in the later stories the full
authority to rule comes only after the death of the
king. But always sooner or later the daughter of
the king conveys the kingdom to her husband.
The sons of the king do not inherit; they are of
much less importance than the daughters; they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>are sent forth to seek their own fortunes. This is
the law where the inheritance passes through the
daughter.</p>

<p>This law of female inheritance must at one time
have been universal. We are brought, indeed, constantly
back to that opinion&mdash;so amply evidenced by
these folk-relics. In the old West country ballad
&#8220;The Golden Vanity&#8221; or &#8220;The Lowland&#8217;s Low,&#8221;
the boy who saves the ship from the Spanish pirate
galleon is promised as a reward &#8220;silver and gold,
with the skipper&#8217;s pretty little daughter who lives
upon the shore.&#8221; Similarly in the well-known folksong
&#8220;The Farmer&#8217;s Boy,&#8221; the lad who comes
weary and lame to the farmer&#8217;s door, seeking work,
eventually marries the farmer&#8217;s daughter and
inherits the farm. Again, Dick Whittington, the
poor country lad, who faithfully serves his master
in London, marries his employer&#8217;s daughter. This
theme is very frequently found in ballads, romances,
and dramas; in all cases the way to fortune for the
lover is through marriage&mdash;the daughter carries the
inheritance.</p>

<p>Let us take Assipattle of the Scottish legend as
a type of these hero wooers. He is represented
always as the youngest son, held in contempt by
his brothers, and merely tolerated by his parents.
He lies in the ashes, from which he gains his name.
Some emergency arises; a great danger threatens
the land or, more often, a princess has to be delivered
from a position of peril. Assipattle executes the
deed, when his brothers and all others have failed;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
he frees the land or rescues the king&#8217;s daughter, and
is covered with honour. He marries the princess
and inherits the kingdom. Assipattle always begins
in the deepest degradation, and ends on the highest
summit of glory. There is a special interest in this
story. The reader will not have failed to notice
the similarity of Assipattle with Cinderella. In both
stories the circumstances are the same, only the
Ash-lad has been replaced by the Cinder-girl. There
is no doubt which version is the older:<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> the one is
the maternal form, the other the patriarchal.</p>

<p>The setting of these stories should be noticed. We
see the simplicity of the habits and life so vividly
represented. All folk-legends deal with country
people living near to nature. So similar, indeed,
are the customs depicted throughout that these
folk-records might well be taken as a picture of the
social organisation among many barbarous tribes.
I should like to wait to point out these resemblances,
such, for instance, as the tendency to personify
natural objects, the identification of human beings
with animals and trees, found so often in the stories,
as well as many other things&mdash;the belief in magic
and the power of wise women. And what I want
to make clear is the very early beginning of these
folk-tales; they take us back to the social institutions
of the mother-age. Thus there is nothing surprising
to find that kingdoms and riches are won by hero-lovers,
and that daughters carry the inheritance.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>This is really what used to happen. It is our individual
ideas and patriarchal customs that make
these things seem so strange.</p>

<p>I wish I had space in which to follow further
these still-speaking relics of a past, whose interest
offers such rich reward. In his essay &#8220;Ashiepattle,
or Hans seeks his Luck&#8221; (<i>The Chances of Death</i>,
Vol. II, pp. 51-91), Prof. Karl Pearson has fully
and beautifully shown the evidence for mother-right
to be found in these stories. To this essay
the reader, who still is in doubt, is referred. All that
has been possible to me is to suggest an inquiry
that any one can pursue for himself. It is the
difficulty of treating so wide and fascinating a subject
in briefest outline that so many things that
should be noticed have to be passed over.</p>

<p>The witness afforded by these folk-stories for
mother-right cannot be neglected. For what interpretation
are we to place on the curious facts they
record? Are we to regard this maternal marriage
with descent through the daughter, and not the son,
as idle inventions of the storytellers? Do these
princesses and their peasant wooers belong to the
topsy-turvy land of fairies? No: in these stories,
drawn from so many various countries, we have
echoes of a very distant past. It is by placing the
customs here represented by the side of similar
social conditions still to be found among primitive
maternal peoples, that we find their significance.
We then understand that these old, old stories of
the folk really take us back to the age in which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
they first took form. We have read these &#8220;fairy
stories&#8221; to our children, unknowing what they
signified&mdash;a prophetic succession of witnesses, pointing
us back to the ripening of that phase of the
communal family, before the establishment of the
individual patriarchal rule, when the law was
mother-right, and all inheritance was through
women.</p>

<p>I would add to this chapter a notice I have just
recently lighted on<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> of the ancient warrior, Queen
Meave of Ireland. She is represented as tall and
beautiful, terrible in her battle chariot, when she
drove full speed into the press of fighting men. Her
virtues were those of a warlike barbarian king, and
she claimed the like large liberty in morals. Her
husband was Ailill, the Connaught king; their
marriage was literally a partnership wherein Meave,
making her own terms, demanded from her husband
exact equality of treatment. The three
essential qualities on which she insisted were that
he should be brave, and generous, and completely
devoid of jealousy.</p>

<h3>CONCLUDING REMARKS</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">My</span> investigation of the mother-age might fitly
have terminated with the preceding chapter; but
the immense interest which attaches to the subject,
and the amount of misconception which prevails
regarding the origin and conditions of the maternal
family, as well as my own special views upon it,
induce me to devote a brief final chapter to a few
observations that to me seem to be important.</p>

<p>In my little book (which must be regarded rather
as a sketch or design than as a finished work) an
attempt has been made to approach the problem of
the primitive family from a new and decisive standpoint.
I am well aware that in certain directions
I have crossed the threshold only of the subjects
treated. I hope that at least I have opened up suggestions
of many questions on which I could not
dwell at length. All this may bring the hesitation
that leads to further inquiry. And I believe that
those of my readers who will follow out an investigation
for themselves in any direction&mdash;either in the
collecting of maternal customs among existing
primitive peoples, or in noting the relics of such
customs to be met with in historical records and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
in folk-lore, will find an ever increasing store of
evidence, and that then the discredited mother-age,
with its mother-right customs, will become for them
what it is for me, a necessary and accepted stage
in the evolution of human societies.</p>

<p>Many of the conclusions to which I have come
are so completely opposed to those which generally
have been accepted as correct, that now, I am at
the end of my inquiry it will be well to sum up
briefly its result.</p>

<p>The facts I have so rapidly enumerated have a
very wide bearing; they serve to destroy the
accepted foundations on which the claim for mother-right
has hitherto been based. The first stage of
the family was patriarchal. All the evidence we
possess tends to show that tracing descent through
the mother was not the primitive custom. Throughout
my aim has been to bring into uniformity the
opposing theories of the primeval patriarchate and
the maternal family. The current view, so often
asserted, and manifestly inspired by a Puritanical
ideal, insists that mother-descent arose through
uncertain fatherhood, and was connected with an
early period of promiscuous relationships between
the two sexes. This view has been proved to be
entirely wrong. The system of maternal descent
was a system framed for order, and had in its origin,
at least, no connection with sexual disorder. Further
than this, it is certain that marriage in some form
has always existed, and that the sexual relationships
have never been unregulated. We must renounce<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
any theory of primitive promiscuity. And there
is more than this to be said. Such freedom in love
and in marriage as we do find in barbarous societies
is so strong a proof of friendly feeling and security
that it is certain it could not have existed in the first
stage of the jealous patriarchate; rather it must
have developed at a subsequent period with the
growth of the social-tribal spirit, and the liberty of
women from the thrall of sexual ownership. In
these particulars my opinion differs from all other
writers who have sought to establish a theory of
matriarchy. I venture to claim that the position
of the mother-age has been strengthened, and, as
I hope, built up on surer foundations.</p>

<p>Let us cast a brief glance backward over the way
that we have travelled.</p>

<p>Our most primitive ancestors, half-men, half-brutes,
lived in small, solitary and hostile family
groups, held together by a common subjection to the
strongest male, who was the father and the owner
of all the women, and their children. There was
no promiscuity, for there could be no possible union
in peace. Here was the most primitive form of
jealous ownership by the male, as he killed or drove
off his rivals; his fights were the brutal precursors
of all sexual restrictions for women. These customs
of brute ownership are still in great measure preserved
among the least developed races. This
explains how there are many rude peoples that
exhibit no traces at all of the system of mother-descent.
In the lowest nomad bands of savages<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
of the deserts and forests we find still these rough
paternal groups, who know no social bonds, but are
ruled alone by brute strength and jealous ownership.
With them development has been very slow; they
have not yet advanced to the social organisation
of the maternal clan.</p>

<p>From these first solitary families, grouped submissively
around one tyrant-ruler, we reach a
second stage out of which order and organisation
sprang. In this second stage the family expanded
into the larger group of the communal clan. The
upward direction of this transformation is evident;
the change was from the most selfish individualism
to a communism more or less complete&mdash;from the
primordial patriarchate to a free social organisation,
all the members of which are bound together by a
strict solidarity of interests. The progress was
necessarily slow from the beginning to this first
phase of social life. Yet the change came. With
the fierce struggle for existence, association was the
only possible way, not only to further progress, but
to prevent extermination.</p>

<p>It has been shown that the earliest movements
towards peace came through the influence of the
women, for it was in their interest to consolidate
the family, and, by means of union, to establish
their own power. Collective motives were more
considered by women, not at all because of any
higher standard of feminine moral virtue, but because
of the peculiar advantages arising to themselves
and to their children&mdash;advantages of freedom which
could not exist in a society inspired by individual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
inclination. And for this reason the clan system
may be considered as a feminine creation, which had
special relation to motherhood. Under this influence,
the marital rights of the male members
were restricted and confined. A system of taboos
was established, which as time advanced was greatly
strengthened by the sacred totem marks, and became
of inexorable strictness. In this way association between
the jealous fighting males was made possible.</p>

<p>Here, then, are the reasons that led to the formation
of the maternal family and the communal clan.
It was a movement that had nothing about it that
was exceptional; it was a perfectly natural arrangement&mdash;the
practical outgrowth of the practical
needs of primitive peoples. The strong and certain
claim for the acceptance for the mother-age, with
its privileged position for women, rests on this
foundation.</p>

<p>Let us be quite clear as to the real question
involved, for it is a crucial one. I refer to the complete
disturbance arising through this change in
the family organisation in the relationships between
the two sexes. A wife was no longer the husband&#8217;s
property. Her position was unchanged by marriage,
for her rights were safeguarded by her kindred,
whose own interests could be protected only through
her freedom.</p>

<p>If we turn next to the status of men&mdash;of the husband
and father&mdash;in the maternal kindred group,
we find their power and influence at first gradually,
and then rapidly, decreasing. It was under these
conditions of family communism that the rights<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
of the husband and father were restricted on every
side. Not only does he not stand out as a principal
person from the background of the familial clan;
he has not even any recognised social existence in
the family group. This restriction of the husband
and father was clearly dependent on the form of
marriage. We have seen that the individual
relationships between the sexes began with the
reception of temporary lovers by the woman in
her own home. But a relationship thus formed would
tend under favourable circumstances to be continued,
and, in some cases, perpetuated. The
lover became the husband; he left the home of
his mother to reside with his wife among her kin; he
was still without property or any recognised rights
in her clan, with no&mdash;or very little&mdash;control over
the woman and none over her children, occupying,
indeed, the position of a more or less permanent
guest in her hut or tent. The wife&#8217;s position and
that of her children was assured, and in the case of a
separation it was the man who departed, leaving
her in possession.</p>

<p>Under such an organisation the family and social
customs were in most cases&mdash;and always, I believe,
in their complete maternal form&mdash;favourable to
women. Kinship was reckoned through the mother,
since in this way alone could the undivided family
be maintained. The continuity of the clan thus
depending on the women, they were placed in a very
special position of importance, the mother was at
least the nominal head of the household, shaping
the destiny of the clan through the aid of her clan-kindred.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Her closest male relation was not her
husband, but her brother and her son; she was
the conduit by which property passed to and from
them. Often women established their own claims and
all property was held by them; which under favourable
circumstances developed into what may literally
be called a matriarchate. In all cases the child&#8217;s
position was dependent entirely on the mother and
not on the father. Such a system of inheritance
may be briefly summarised as &#8220;mother-right.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is another matter to notice. Every possible
experiment in sexual association has been tried,
and is still practised among various barbarous
races, with very little reference to those moral ideas
to which we are accustomed. It is, however, very
necessary to remember that monogamy is frequent
and indeed usual under the maternal system. We
have seen many examples where, with complete
freedom of separation held by the wife, lasting and
most happy marriages are the rule. When the
husband lives with his wife in a dependent position to
her family he can do so only in the case of one woman.
For this reason polygamy is much less deeply rooted
under the conditions in which the communal life
is developed than in patriarchal communities. In
the complete maternal family it is never common,
and is even prohibited.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p>As we might expect, the case is quite opposite
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>with polyandry. This form of marriage has evident
advantages for women when compared with polygamy;
it is also a form that requires a certain
degree of social civilisation. It clearly involves
the limitation of the individual marital rights of the
husband. Polyandry in the joint family group was
not due to a licentious view of marriage; far otherwise,
it was an expression of the communism which
is characteristic of this organisation. This fact
has been forgotten by many writers, who have
regarded this form of the sexual relationships as
a very primitive development, connected with group-marriage
and promiscuous ownership of women.
It is very necessary to be clear on this point. Under
the maternal conditions, nothing is more certain
than the equality of women with men in all questions
of sexual morality. In proof of this it is necessary
only to recall the facts we have noted. We find
little or no importance attached to virginity, which
in itself indicates the absence of any conception of the
woman as property. Thus no bride-price is claimed
from the husband, who renders service in proof
of his fitness as a lover, not to gain possession of the
bride. The girl is frequently the wooer, and, in
certain cases, she or her mother imposes the conditions
of the marriage. After marriage the free
provision for divorce (often more favourable to the
wife than to the husband) is perhaps of even greater
significance. There can, I think, be no doubt that
this freedom in love was dependent on the wife&#8217;s
position of security under the maternal form of
marriage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>I hold that the facts brought forward entitle
us to claim that the maternal communal clan was
an organisation in which there was a freer community
of interest, far more fellowship in labour
and partnership in property, with a resulting liberty
for woman, than we find in any patriarchal society.
For this reason, shall we, then, look back to this
maternal stage as to a golden period, wherein was
realised a free social organisation, carrying with it
privileges for women, which even to-day among
ourselves have never been established, and only
of late claimed? It is a question very difficult to
answer, and we must not in any haste rush into
mistakes. We found that the mother-age was
a transitional stage in the history of the evolution
of society, and we have indicated the stages of
its gradual decline. It is thus proved to have been
a less stable social system than the patriarchate
which again succeeded it, or it would not have
perished in the struggle with it. Must we conclude
from this that the one form of the family is higher
than the other&mdash;that the superior advantage rests
with the patriarchal system? Not at all: rather
it proves how difficult is the struggle to socialise.
Human nature tends so readily towards individualism;
it yields itself up to the joy of possession whenever
it is possible.</p>

<p>The impulse to dominate by virtue of strength
or property possession has manifested itself in every
age. It cannot be a matter of surprise, therefore,
that at this period of social development a rebellion
arose against the customs of maternal communism.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Within the large and undivided family of the clan
the restricted family became gradually re-established
by a reassertion of individual interests. In proportion
as the family gained in importance (which would
arise as the struggle for existence lessened and the
need of association was less imperative) the interest
of the individual members would become separated
from the group to which they belonged. Each one
would endeavour to get himself as large a share
as possible of what was formerly held in common.
As society advanced property would increase in
value, and the social and political significance of
its possession would also increase. Afterwards,
when personal property was acquired, each man
would aim at gaining a more exclusive right over
his wife and children; he would not willingly
submit to the bondage of the maternal form of
marriage.</p>

<p>In the earlier days the clan spirit was too strong,
now men had shaken off, to a degree sufficient for
their purpose, the female yoke, which bound the
clan together. We have seen the husband and
father moving towards the position of a fully acknowledged
legal parent by a system of buying off his
wife and her children from their clan-group. The
movement arose in the first instance through a
property value being connected with women themselves.
As soon as the women&#8217;s kindred found in
their women the possibility of gaining worldly
goods for themselves, they began to claim service
and presents from their lovers. It was in this way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
for economic reasons, and for no moral considerations
that the maternal marriage fell into disfavour.
The payment of a bride-price was claimed, and an
act of purchase was accounted essential. As we
have seen, it was regarded as a condition, not so
much of the marriage itself, but of the transference
of the wife to the home of the husband and of the
children to his kindred. The change was, of course,
effected slowly; and often we find the two forms
of marriage&mdash;the maternal and the purchase-marriage&mdash;occurring
side by side. What, however,
is certain is that the purchase-marriage in the
struggle was the one that prevailed.</p>

<p>This reversal in the form of the marriage brought
about a corresponding reversal in the status of
women. This is so plain. The women of the
family do not now inherit property, but are themselves
property, passing from the hands of their
father to that of a husband. As purchased wives
they are compelled to reside in the husband&#8217;s house
and among his kin, who have no rights or duties
in regard to them, and where they are strangers.
In a word, the wife occupies the same position of
disadvantage as the man had done in the maternal
marriage. And her children kept her bound to
this alien home in a much closer way than the
husband could ever have been bound to her home.
The protection of her own kindred was the source
of the woman&#8217;s power and strength. This was now
lost. The change was not brought about without a
struggle, and for long the old customs contended<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
with the new. But as the patriarchate developed,
and men began to gain individual possession of
their children by the purchase of their mothers,
the father became the dominant power in the
family. Little by little individual interests prevailed.
Moral limits were set up. Women&#8217;s freedom
was threatened on every side as the jealous
ownership, which always arises wherever women
are regarded as property, asserted itself. Mother-right
passed away, remaining only as a tradition, or
preserved in isolated cases among primitive peoples.
The patriarchal age, which still endures, succeeded.</p>

<p>Yet in this connection it is very necessary to
remember that the reassertion of the patriarchate
was as necessary a stage in human development
as the maternal stage. Whatever may have been
the advantages arising to women from the clan
organisation (and that the advantages were great
I claim to have proved) such conditions could not
remain fixed for ever. For society is not stable;
it cannot be, as the need for adjustment is always
arising, and at certain stages of development different
tendencies are active. No one cause can be isolated,
and, therefore, it is necessary in estimating any
change to take a synthetic view of many facts that
are contemporaneous and interacting. Yet, it
would seem that the social and domestic habits
of a people are decided largely by the degree of
dominance held either by women or men; and almost
everything else depends on the accurate adjustment
of the rights of the two sexes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>The social clan organised around the mothers
carried mankind a long way&mdash;a way the length of
which we are only beginning to realise. But it
could not carry mankind to that family organisation
from which so much was afterwards to develop.
It was no more possible for society to be built up
on mother-right alone than it is possible for it to
remain permanently based on father-right.</p>

<p>But there is another aspect of this question that
I must briefly touch upon. The opinion that the
reversal in the position of authority of the mother
and the father arose from male mastery, or was due
to any unfair domination on the part of the husband
must be set aside. To me the history of the mother-age
does not teach this. I believe that the change
to the individual family must have been regarded
favourably by the women themselves, for such
a change could not have arisen, at all events it
would not have persisted, if women, with the power
they then enjoyed, had not desired it. Nor need this
bring any surprise. An arrangement that would
give a closer relationship in marriage and the protection
of a husband for herself and her children
may well have come to be preferred by the wife.
Nor do I think it unlikely that she, quite as strongly
as the man, may have desired to live apart from her
mother and her kindred in her husband&#8217;s home.
Individual interests are not confined to men.</p>

<p>With all the evils father-right has brought to
women, we have got to remember that the woman
owes the individual relation of the man to herself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
and her children to the patriarchal system. The
father&#8217;s right in his children (which, unlike the right
of the mother, was not founded upon kinship, but
rested on the quite different and insecure basis
of property) had to be re-established. Without
this being done, the family in its complete development
was impossible. The survival value of the
patriarchal age consists in the additional gain to
the children of the father&#8217;s to the mother&#8217;s care.
I do not think this gain will ever be lost. We women
need to remember this lest bitterness stains our
sense of justice. It may be that progress could not
have been accomplished otherwise; that the cost
of love&#8217;s development has been the enslavement of
women. If so, then women will not, in the long
account of Nature, have lost in the payment of
the price. They may be (when they come again
to understand their power) better fitted for their
refound freedom.</p>

<p>Such is the history of the past, what is the promise
of the future?</p>

<p>We have traced three stages in the past evolution
of the family&mdash;two individual and patriarchal,
one communal and maternal. Is the patriarchal
stage, then, the final stage? Has the upward
growth, ever yet continuous, been arrested here?
The social ideal of the mother-age was a transition
and a dream&mdash;but as a moment of peace in the
records of struggle, following the bloody opening
drama in man&#8217;s history, and then passing into a
forgetfulness so complete that its existence by many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
has been denied. Yet the feet of the race were
in the way, though men and women let it pass,
blindly unknowing.</p>

<p>Our age is working for scarcely yet formulated
changes in the ownership of property and in the
status of women. The patriarchal view of woman&#8217;s
subjection to man is being questioned in every
direction. What do these movements indicate?
If, as seems probable, the individual evolution,
already for so long continued, is perishing, what is
to take its place? What form will the family take
in the future? These are questions to which it is
not possible for me here even to attempt to find the
answer.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p>Let us look for a moment in this new direction,
the direction of the future, because it is there that
the past becomes so important. In our contemporary
society there is a deep-lying dissatisfaction
with existing conditions, a yearning and restless
need for change. We stand in the first rush of a
great movement. It is the day of experiments,
when again the old customs are in struggle with the
new. We are questioning where before we have
accepted, and are seeking out new ways in which
mankind will go&mdash;will go because it must.</p>

<p>Social institutions alter very slowly as a rule;
for long a change may pass unnoticed, until one day
it is discovered that a step forward has been taken.
Those changes that appear so new and are bringing
fear to many to-day, are but the last consequences
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>of causes that for long have been operating slowly.
The extraordinary enthusiasm now sweeping through
womanhood reveals behind its immediate feverish
expression a great power of emotional and spiritual
initiative. Wide and radically sweeping are the
changes in women&#8217;s outlook. So much stronger
is the promise of a vital force when they have refound
their emancipation. To this end women must gain
economic security, and the freedom for the full
expression of their womanhood. The ultimate
goal I conceive&mdash;at least I hope&mdash;is the right to be
women, not the right to become like men. There
can be no gain for women except this. To be mothers
were women created and to be fathers men. This
rightly considered is the deepest of all truths.</p>

<p>What is needed at present is that women should
be allowed to rediscover for themselves what is their
woman&#8217;s work, rather than that they should continue
to accept perforce the r&ocirc;le which men (rightly or
wrongly) have at various times allowed to them
throughout the patriarchal ages. This necessity is
as much a necessity for men as it is for women.</p>

<p>I do not think that women will fail (even if for
a time they stumble a little) in finding the way.
The vital germinal spot of each forward step in
women&#8217;s position must be sought with the women
who are the conscious mothers of the race. The
great women reformers are not those who would
have women act just like men in all externals,
but those who are conscious that all men are born
of women. In this lies women&#8217;s strength in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
past and in this must be their strength in
that glad future that is to be. But only if
motherhood is regarded as an intrinsic glory, and
children are born in freedom. Think what this
means. The birth of a child, in so far as its mother
has not received the sanction of a man, is subject
to the fire and brimstone of public scorn. And this
scorn is the most pitiful result in all the patriarchal
record. A woman&#8217;s natural right is her right to be
a mother, and it is the most inglorious page in the
history of woman that too often she has allowed herself
to be deprived of that right. Women have this
lesson first to learn. We, and not men, must fix the
standard in sex, for we have to play the chief part in
the racial life. Let us, then, reacquire our proud instinctive
consciousness, which we are fully justified
in having, of being the mothers of humanity; and
having that consciousness, once more we shall be
invincible.</p>

<h1>THE TRUTH ABOUT WOMAN</h1>

<p class="center" style="font-size: 140%; font-weight: bold">By C. GASQUOINE HARTLEY<br />

<small>(Mrs. Walter Gallichan)</small></p>

<p class="center"><i>Fourth Edition <span style="padding-left: 3em">7s. 6d. net</span></i></p>

<p class="center"><b><i>SOME PRESS OPINIONS</i></b></p>

<p>&#8220;<i>The best written and the most profitable of the many recent books
upon the woman&#8217;s movement.</i> It is distinguished alike by the scope of
its learning, the skilful way in which evidence is marshalled, and, above
all, by the independence of thought and temper brought to the interpretation
of the modern issues.... The discussion of sex differences
and of the social problems which spring therefrom shows not only wide
and deep personal acquaintance with modern men and women, but a
singular freedom from some of the squeamishness of thought and feeling
which hampers most discussion ... <i>an exceedingly important contribution
to the most difficult problem of our and every other time</i>.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">J.
A. Hobson</span> in <i>The Manchester Guardian</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>The book shows a fearless intellectual honesty and a deep sympathy
and tolerance; it is the work of a serious student and of a woman who
knows life as well as libraries....</i> The chapter on &#8216;Sexual Differences
in Mind&#8217; is absorbingly interesting, and based on the latest research.
She writes finely and truly on the absurd and indecent cruelty of
penalising divorce; on the cherished superstition of feminine passivity
in love, and the origin of the chastity taboo on women with its waste of
life and love. She even has a sane and humane chapter on prostitution,
recognising the complexity of its causes, and the kindness and generosity
of these scapegoat women to one another, as well as their erotic insensibility.
<i>The book should be read by all educated men and women.</i>
It will probably be greeted with screams of denunciation from those
persons whose hostility forms a hall-mark of mental honesty and social
value.&#8221;&mdash;<i>The English Review.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;We very heartily commend this remarkable book.... Every
chapter abounds in challenges to thought, and we must thank a woman
who has dared and cared to think and dared to say.&#8221;&mdash;<i>The Pall Mall
Gazette.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;One of the most thoughtful books about women I have yet read....
The book is certainly of an advanced feminism, yet the author is found
most strongly on the side of marriage, of love, of women&#8217;s femininity as
their strength; in fact, of all the things which shallow observers suppose
the woman movement is actively denying.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Truth.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Sane, sound, and well reasoned ... she has more capacity than
